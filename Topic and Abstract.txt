Twitch is a popular livestreaming service, largely used for people to stream themselves whilst playing video games and interacting with their audience via text-based chatroom. However, the attention that some games require, along with the potentially large volume of messages, can make it difficult for streamers to keep up with their audience. Our proposed solution is to create a conversational AI that reads and responds to messages in the chatroom in accordance with how the streamer would answer. This is not intended to replace streamer interaction with their audience, but rather to field general or frequently asked questions and lessen the workload on the streamer. We will be using Python scripting to create this AI and the twitch.tv site to run and test it.
