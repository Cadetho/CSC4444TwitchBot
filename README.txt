====================

HOW TO INSTALL THE CHATBOT:
1. Use the instructions at: https://github.com/Conchylicultor/DeepQA, specifically the "Installation" part
  1.1 You will need the "model.data" file, it's large so could not be uploaded to GH. Find a link in our discord chat, download it and put it in the "/save/model" directory.
2. Open "settings.py" and supply your OAUTH key and CHANNEL name
3. Run the bot with "python main.py --test twitch"

HOW TO USE THE CHATBOT:
1. Go to Twitch.tv to your chatroom
2. Send a message to the bot using "@username", where the "username" is the username of the CHANNEL you've supplied before
3. Enjoy the intelligent conversation!
