Where?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Is he oily or dry?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're welcome.
In 9th.  For a month
You did what?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Exactly my point
Otherwise known as an orgy?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
So they tell me...
Get out!
Why not?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Her favorite uncle
Don't make me do it, man
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
That's never been proven
No fear.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I know a lot more than that
Just let me sit down.
I thought you were above all that
This.
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
What are you doing here?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Acting the way we do.
Fallacy.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Because you're making decisions for me.
Bianca did what?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
But -- who -- what --?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Thank God...
May I ask by whom?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You think I don't know that?
I'm coming with you.
But it's...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Can I see your back?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Right.
I'll make some for us.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Any I.D.?
Stay with her.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
I'm on duty.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
What do you want?
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Alright.
Hey.
Answer the phone.
Tonight.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
I am butcher.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Why not?
Good idea!
Cut!
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
It's easy to learn.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
But you knew that, right?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Don't stoop to his level!
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Sure, what is it?
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Oh?
I guess it isn't.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
In three days, darling, I hope.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I see.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Opening pod bay doors.
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I may call you worse than that.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Jesus.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
No class...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah, I read the report...
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'll help you out.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You're hopeless.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
How do you know?
So what?
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
We got a lot to talk about.
First, the money.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Corn-i-Lius?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
She dropped in on me... holding this.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
What kind of mission?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Hey bud! Finger here.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Leeloo..
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Hi Ma...
Not without Leeloo.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're the only one left alive...
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Three of us will never fit in there!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Uh...
I want to sleep... forever...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Actually only one cell survived..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Okay, I believe you.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
I just talked to her.
There's nothing harder.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
What can I do for you today?
Is it?
I'll consider it.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Look, I don't know what this...
I remember him.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
How much did he pay you?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Easy enough for you.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
That's right.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
I was well compensated.
They're no friends of mine.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Sounds good, pops.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Nothing remotely like this.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
No.
No.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
I didn't mean to...
Okay.
Are you religious?
You should be.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes.  I remember her.
Cash.
No, you may not.
Okay.  Fine.
I can't find him.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
You just feel sorry for me.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
What?
It's okay, Dan
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
She doesn't want me around
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
You're right.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Meaning?
But I've seen her grave.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Huh?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
What???
Wonderful!
There's got to be an explanation!
Huh?
Take a look.
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Who?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You played for the Sox?
Not here.
Shit.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
It's fun.
Yes.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
The key, Wade.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Something about my father?
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
In the living room.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Wade, are you alright?
Put your pilot on.
This doesn't make sense.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Roger.
Any of us?
Well it worked.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Scared. We're scared.
What do you know of my husband?
That was war.
No.
Twenty minutes?
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
I might still have a few chips left.
That's my job.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
What word would you use, Elaine?
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Set!
I mean for Ted.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
But if you'll just give me...
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I'm Randy.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
The cockpit? What is it?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
You don't have squat.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Who else can I ask around here?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You?
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
See you soon.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
I get the picture.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Forget it.
Alive?
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
No.  Have you?
Fuck you.
You're just reading me.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Terrible.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Can we dream?
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
No.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
I'm so relieved.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Of course.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Isn't it obvious?
Not at all.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
Oh, yes.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Hey!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
It's just a trifle, of course.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Your Highness.
Yes?
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Of course not.
Well, look at them.
Ah-ha.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
How is your financial situation?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
This one will.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Mine?
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Is he working?
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
What is this?
Can I see it?
Because there's nothing to see.
Madame.
What for?
My answer is no, Mozart.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
I can't say. Really
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Consigned to flames of woe.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Yes!
You go fast!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What is what?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Where?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
But not his body.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
About the ballet.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Who is she?
But he's all right?
Of course.
Thank you.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
What did he say?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
What shall we do?
No, why?
No, not really.
I beg your pardon?
Do you like it?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you think about it?
Not just a patient -- me.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
A werewolf?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I've left those pills for you.
I should be committed.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Chart says he's from New York.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Now see here young man.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
No, but we're about to.
That's very funny, that is.
You could have told them!
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Lunatic?
Did you see Jack?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
You're not having a good time are you?
You're talking about the woman I love.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
I don't know. Come on.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
I wanted to see you.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You don't have to say anything.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
No.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I want to know why .
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Well, you can. You always could.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Don't you know?
I want to be near you!
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Hello, darling.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
No.
I don't know.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All right. Send him in.
Got my letter?
Hello, Helen.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
No.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Was it twelve o'clock?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
That was two hours ago.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Nope.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Tell me.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
It was exciting.
Sorry.
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Get buckets!
What?
My little Web did that?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I reckoned.
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Don't care.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
They're making him a hero now.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Hmm" what?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
You are a hell of a woman.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I figured.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
You do that.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Not at all.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I remember you.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It is a nice piece of writing.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I can't believe this.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
I can't.
Pick me up?
What do you want, Courtney?
Maybe.
Is your Evian spiked?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
No.
The message you left.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Where are you going?
Like what?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Negative. Cancel it.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Thanks, Patrick.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Forget it.
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Uh huh?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Well...
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Well, I could he wrong.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
But Marcus denied it?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and –  - you.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Speak up. Come on.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
...Why?
Milo, you --
...What?
Great.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Outpost doesn't own em.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Sure.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You do?
Those really weird, short lines.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You're compulsive.
Then and now.  But not right now.
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
What?
You mean -- break in?
Gary.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Please don't go.
But you said the other --
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Did you tell Alice?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Where is he?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Kiss me.
Thanks.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Groovy!
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
My wedding tackle.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Here, use mine.
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Let me see.
I don't get it.
Why?
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Is it one of ours?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Great.
How's Austin?
Why?
What about his teeth?
I just don't see it.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.

Really -- what happened in 1922?
People, too.
After the cold war ...
To you ... ?
So am I.
Next assignment?
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
For a man in my position --
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Because you always obey orders ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
I'm playing to win.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Have we been invited?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Still a bit chilly ...
Have you any place in mind?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Half-brother to be precise.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Amnesia?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
This way ...
Walk over to the window ...
Perish the thought.
But did they teach you this?
That's not playing by the rules.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Cole...
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
What is this person's story here?
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
But how can I do that?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Oh... I got something for that.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.
Good...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Yeah.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Screw that.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Feel free.
No, Brett, I...
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
About what?
I'm proud of you, lad.
Got me.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
I don't know.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
We're gonna be okay, man...
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
It works.
That was never proved.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Hey.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Roll the hose.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
Huh.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Then who --
Sure you do.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
But he killed these guys.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Backdraft.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Coffee sucked.
Well, let's have a look.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
-- You remember.
Okay.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And old ladies?
Don't you have any leads at all?
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
You mean you could use it.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
Yeah. I'm sure.
What money?
This psycho can.
I'm on it.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Did he gots to be.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
Why are you smiling so?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
So that's what you been doing?
You can walk away.  We both can.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
We was coming to see you.
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
It's me, Peerless.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pleased to meet you.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Everybody shut up.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
That's why it will be so much fun.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
No.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
It looks delicious.
Finland.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
I thought you got rid of...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
What else?
Are you trying to rap to me?
Maybe you need to start.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
I don't know.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Only the agency of servants.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
If not you, then who?
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
What happened to "degrees"?
But you didn't.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I didn't do anything --
Because I was standing next to him.
Maybe --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
What the hell are you talking about --
Yeah.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Why?
Good cop/bad cop?
I lost a bet.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I don't know.
But you will.
What?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Tough.
You're a good man, Hardy.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Then it's unofficial.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes!
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Good luck, kid.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
How did you know?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Please. Go. Just go.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
I never knew.
You were talking about your wedding.
You don't like it?
Make him stop.
Did you do any of that?
Really.
You mean, while I'm here.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
You know where the chemicals are?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You think I'm fake.
Okay. Okay.
How did you get so many?
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
I need to lie down for a bit.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
No I haven't.
Uh... Yes.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Yes. I know.
Good. 
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
No. It is too judgmental.
You can stay tonight.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
You don't understand anything.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
What?
Have you got your passport?
Sometimes.
Why?
So now you hate all women?
You don't understand you either.
Get out
Get out.
Well what have you got?
No.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I'm trying to quit.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know.
Well. It's good to see you.
Oh, she older than that.
Don't make it less true.
You liked what I brung ya?
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Better than what you give.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I ain't in a hurry.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
I tried.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
This Rae... you get with her?
Now, hold up.
Uh-huh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Ask the chef.
Then what?
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Holy shit!
What?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe we should do something?
Not a prayer.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
No.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Maybe we should bail?
Hey, all right.
Connie...
What's the problem here?
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Nick...
There she is!
Are we getting married?
Ichiro --
You were too far behind.
I want to yank Kobo.
No.
I can't...
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
What if I chant?
Then take it from him.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
What?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Right.
We're police officers.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
You had my help, detective.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Where?
Then go get him.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Like what?
Of course not.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Yeah.
Got it.
Why, yes, of course.
I think we're through for the night.
Longevity is classified.  No.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Thank you very much.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Let's hear it.
Huh huh.
Nope.
What if you change your mind?
Too old.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
I bet I would.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Ugh.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Where is he?
I wish I could.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
I'll see you in a minute.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Don't move.
Same thing.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
What's your problem?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
You're all so perfect.
Bravo!
I'm Adam Webber.
Really?
Sure.
For how long?
Oh, brother...
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do ya?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
What is it?!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
I think it's the eyes.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Because I want to get married.
The big one!
They're all divorced?
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Never drive again!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Eve, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Sing it to me.
Really?  Okay!
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Yes, it is.
Your mom made that all by herself.
These are really swell! I mean swell!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Yes, father?! Yes?
That's what everybody believes?
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You nut!
Russia.
Yeah.
True.
Almost all of them.
You bet!
Goodbye.
Of what?
Twenty-five? Around there.
Goodnight.
Say what?!
Yes, ma'am.
I'll go up.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Yeah.
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Well, that's blunt!
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
No.
To bed?
Yes, you do.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
And if we can't find him?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Well.
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
Do you love me?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
Okay Frank.
Be right down.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Uh-uh.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Brilliant.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Okay, okay. Bye.
What am I going to do?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Just some fatherly advice.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Up where?
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
You think they sold me out? No way.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I-I'll tip her.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Ma, what's wrong?
BLAME...
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
What?
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
A bit.
Aye.
Yes, we are.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Of course they were. How many?
Male or female, bitch?!!
The Sicilians.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
I'll be back at 9:00.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Well, what'ya do?
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
God's permission? God doesn't...
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
God have mercy on my soul.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
OK. That's wrong.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Yeah.
Dignan! Stop!
We got it. We got it.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Obviously. That's a given.
Yes... It's true.
We said 48 hours.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
You don't know how to hotwire.
I know.
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I did.
Yes. I do.
Applejack! What's happening?
Careful. Check his pulse.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
That's a sharp jacket.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
That sounds like Dignan.
No, that door over there.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Yeah. He said that.
He looked too shaken-up.
Is that OK?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
It was stupid.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
My brother.
Let's cut the bullshit.
You're paranoid, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Maybe she turned.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
Did we get it?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
My brother's in jail.
That could be anybody's.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Bob, that makes no sense.
I know it's not.
Anthony. Bad news.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Take him to the car, Bob.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Now!
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
We're just going over a few things.
Well, I think --
Will it track back to us?
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Excuse me.
May I finish?
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Keep going...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Okay.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know.
-- it hasn't been two years --
I worry when you get like this.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
We can't wait to be sure.
-- where? -
-- it's just him? --
There must be another way!
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Bourne?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Some women like Dobermans --
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Felt promising. It's a start.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
You mock us with a smile?
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Three, maybe more!
That depends on the man.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
...I wouldn't know.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I am trying.
Anything.
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
You know the answer to that.
I... I don't remember.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How long will I be in here?
You know my father?
Where are you now?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
What?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
We'll find out soon enough.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
My husband is with me, too.
No.
He did. Captain Renault did.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Well?
I'm sorry. It is.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Come up here a minute.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
It's not for sale at any price.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Put them on the table.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I don't understand. What about you?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
No, Victor, no.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
-- Yes?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Thank you.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Perhaps not.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Victor Laszlo?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Yeah? Why?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
I don't want them here overnight.
He'll double what I pay you.
Then don't have a drink.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Take it, damn it.
Survive today, that's the point.
Die tomorrow or die today.
Then we've just got shit.
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Sure.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
I had it on the island with me.
Let's take a look.
Cold.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Could you watch Jango?
I would never --
I know.
You have any children?
I don't know.  I really don't know.
You too.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
Let's eat.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
It's me.
I braided them.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
To life.
That's all there is.
I need to do it.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I'm sorry, Homer.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Better than I can!
I know.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
I don't remember.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Actually, I volunteered.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
I guess so...
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
You do it then.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
It's just my heart.
Almost.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
But you don't look very happy.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Sorry, Homer...
We see you next harvest.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
What's lucky about that?
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
I don't follow.
And these cops? What do they get?
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Today? Started off great...
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Well, this is just fucking great...
Two million.
Calls?
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
That's it.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I think I just broke my hand.
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Great. Thank you.
Very much so.
You interested in a little work?
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Why?
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Sounds respectable.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Then shut up.
My place.
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
My fucking heart bleeds.
That was fucking deep.
Keep it up.
What?
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Confidence. It's just confidence.
Roger that.
To who?
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Jack Manfred.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about it.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What's the Blue Book price?
I want a job, Giles.
And your lady?
I won't be that long.
I. sold the car.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Tension. It'll go.
Why not?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Leave it.
It will.
Gambling's not about money.
How can anyone be that naive?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Don't let yourself down.
You know where I'm from?
First visit to London?
In the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Ross.
Over the river.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I'm not going to report it.
That bitch? No.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Five.
I said good call.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
No.
Bruised.
What flickering light?
The key!
Where is the key?
Doolittle, are you there?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Talby, can you read me?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Energy shielding positive function.
The only thing which exists is myself.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
To explode, of course.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah... pity, pity...
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Oh, yeah?
I'm on a break.
That's a lotta crap.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
You're roommates?
I ain't mad at you...
Yech...
Look, I'd really like to...
Hello...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
First time I ever heard that.
Who is...
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Too early to tell.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Yeah...
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
A girl.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
Bastard...
You and me both.
No.
Yeah.
A long time.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
Pull the cash.
I have sincere eyes.
She's got my word.
You're the best, Maxie.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Tell everybody hey.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
We gotta talk.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
You left out condescending.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Lydia.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
Easy Sketchy.
Shut-up...
I want you on call here.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Got any KISS?
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
YO, DOOFUS!
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Curly.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Sure.
Hawk?
They're what?
Check.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
But, mom!
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
What happened?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Yeah.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
What did you say?
Our saviour...
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Take it off. I want to see you.
I don't wanna talk about it.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
Well...
The Lifeline is divided that way.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Where it came from?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
Frank is going to kill.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Guess who wrote it?
What's her name?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Yep.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
There's no rule!
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
Yeah, you betcha...
You-betcha.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Really?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
And the bite marks on my ears?
Hi.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Mm-hm.
Dakota.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
What!
This is -- what?
Harold!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Take a letter...
What's the matter with you?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Half watch dog?
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Then I demand an apology!
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
That's not bad for any day.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Why -- why -- of course.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
And here are my mother and father.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
...Yes, Sir.
I don't understand.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I don't know what I've got.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Oh no?
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Hello...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
The hospital?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Yes! The workhouse!
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Pardon me?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
But you LOVED her all the same...
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Then let go!
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Odin!
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
She got me thinking...
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Why should WE care?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
But you're the Gods!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Well, come on!
But...
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
She MUST have a knife or something...
Well, where is he then?
Your lord.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
I... I...
Get away, Snorri.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Can't make enough swords!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You fool!
I know, Dad.
Stop it!
Sh!
I never do...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I told you that later.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Okay, I guess.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Really? Because --
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yes?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
It's okay.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
I'm not a stalker.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
I don't know.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
It's pretty.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I want to know you.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
What do you mean?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I love it!
I'm sure, I said.
Is that what you want?
I did it. I guess that means something.
Well, you're married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Me too. There's this poem --
Let's move into this neighborhood.
It's dark.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
A bully? Moi?
I don't know.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I guess so.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Go back to sleep.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
'kay.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
What?
Well, what should we do?
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Thanks, Stan.
Nothing.
Then why did you ask me?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Is that Nietzsche?
It's no big deal.
You are such a sweetheart.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
It was a mutual decision.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Then check the connections.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Jesus, Patrick!
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
Whooee!
Tired...
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
The containment, Second Containment...
I'll get him.
On my way.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Please... kill...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That is not acceptable --
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
If it worked, yes.
I don't know.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
How much oh-two do we have?
No. It was someone else.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Five seconds.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
He's been past Mars?
Get them back --
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
What did he do to the uniform?!
Where do you think? With Sue.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He's made a few changes.
Yeah, nine years straight.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
And they're changing into...
That's terrible news...
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I though we went over this.
Ben! Ben!
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Girl...?!
Showtime.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Front page?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Great minds think alike.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
We need to get past them.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Of course. Of course.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Hilarious.
I understand the business reasons.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Susan. What are you doing?
Totally.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Sis.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I didn't say that.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
What? Are you all right?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
I'm really pretty busy...
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I thought he was out of town.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
You'll always remember your first time.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
No. But it's a nice idea.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Really?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right! Oh, yeah!
I know, everyone says that.
How about the point?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
Oh yeah.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Righto!
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
WHAT?
What?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
No, she's looking for you.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll be back.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the rest of 'em?
And the head?
Fuck no.
Who's with me?
My truck.
Your parents of relation?
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Huh?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Seven.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
What?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Stop her!
Right.
I'd love to.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Excuse me, sir?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
You see: We've got to change that name.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
My clothes?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
You're afraid!
Who is she?
Who?
Who?
...Yes.
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I know you believe that.
You wrote it, didn't you?
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Kurt!
Occupation?
...Not if I can help it.
Don't touch me.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Yeah, well --
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
...So you think I should go.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I know what ability you're interested in.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
The hell you will, Harry York.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Calm down, Frances.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
You can't drink.
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
What's that?
I got your number, Mister Man.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
How did I look?
I'm not sure.
And no people.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
But I want to. I'm trying!
I already have.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
What?
Go on...
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
I'm going out!
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Oh bullshit.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I see.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Frances, I'm warning you...
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Not as weak as I.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
A... week?
You've been going round-the-clock?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I'm... dying.
I heard.
No, no, they're all dead...
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Maybe I can help?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Hey, guys!
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Thanks.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
That was the telephone.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Good call.
I guess...
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
How much do I owe you?
That's thirty percent.
Yeah.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Twenty-eight.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
What's this about, money?
Yes, she is.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Pass.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
What's in Mexico?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Yes.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
-- you got your microwave --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
What?
Or what?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
I'm here with you.
Okay, I'll have one.
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Fuck me.
I'll act surprised.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Come on, Montgomery...
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I oughtta report you.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Well, now I feel so much better.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
They had to kill 'em?
He was married?
At first.
Not me.  You?
Mighta been civilian.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Should I be afraid?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Great. See ya then.
Oh yes he will.
What?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
This is not the place...
Oh, I'm not married.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Me too.
That is when we will go in.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
It's Tatopoulos.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
That's right.
Sounds like a big company.
Why do you need that?
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Where's my bed?
Is that the bathroom?
Right... Sorry, sir.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Open.
I'm... I'm shot.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
"Just!?"
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
You go first! There's no time!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
What's the weather like outside?
... What does that mean?
It's suicide.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Your last name.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
We're doing episode 31?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
What the hell are you talking about?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Stop, please! I don't know!
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
As you wish.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Then how did he find out about the device?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
But... Inside, I have seen-
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
What kind of signal?
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
That can't be.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
These supplies...?
Surely you knew this was coming.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We're leaving them?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
I think I will disappoint you.
Yes!
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
We'll get it later.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
What money?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
It's a different kind of deal.
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Sovereign.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
So what's the problem?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Hey, Harry.
You have it?
Who?
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
What're you doing here?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
There a part in it for you?
What do you get out of it?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
I'm thinking about producing.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Why not?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
So whoever did this might still be around.
Hell yeah.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
I don't know, are we?
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Epps, over.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
What do you say, Dodge?
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Lost my sea legs.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
But I can't --
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, yes...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
You need counseling.
Hi.
I guess.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
That's just the way I am!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Okay... I promise.
What?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Gross.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
I didn't get it either.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
No, really...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
You're insane.
How repulsive!
Why? What did he say?
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Norman.
I did too!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Wow!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Really? Can I see it?
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Good luck...
Yeah, well...
Every guy has a type!
PLEASE? We have to!
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Why?
How can you be so sure?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What about Joe?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I am.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
That slut!
Let me see the sick.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
So work must be going well?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
What?
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
That's what the books say... 
I can try.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Oh no.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Same difference.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
Now you're talking.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
I know.
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Who are they?
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
I knew that.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who, Ray?
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
She's new in town.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Well don't think!
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Have I done the right thing?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
What?
I know.  It happened by itself.
Who's the stiff?
Can't you tell me now?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I want you inside me.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Print is dead.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
What calls?
Has this ever happened before?
The magic word is "please."
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Two wavy lines?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wow!
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Neutronize.  System shut.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
For what purpose?
Where are you, Pete?
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Well, that ought to do it.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
But have never been?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Well, they die for it!
Chain him.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
I'd love some.
I just want to tell you something.
All right.
I'm glad.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
Oh my God --
Don't cry. 
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
You've got to tell me what she said.
If you want.
The marble?
What?
Is that so? You might marry me?
We just can.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Plastics.
Oh -- no sir.
I am going to call the police now.
Right.
Did you get a room?
What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A single. Just for myself, please.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
What?
Of course.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
What?
What?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
I don't know.
No.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
No.
My husband will be back quite late.
What do you think?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
On that chair in the hall.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Okay.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You what?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
I don't.
I got up.
What one.
I don't remember.
What?
Thank you.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
But you don't hate him.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Because I don't want you to.
Benjamin?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Different.
No.
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Sir?
Ben, can I say something to you?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Why?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Dad -- can you listen --
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Yes.
Need any help?
Have you got that skeleton key?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
How?
No -- why? -- should I?
Very little.
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
What?
You're very funny --
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Oh -- 
I don't want them now.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Why?
As you will.
I must have made a mistake.
Be quiet.
Most imposters are --
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
You're trembling.
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I understand you perfectly.
Well -- you want me?
I understand perfectly.
Of course -- of course. 
A thousand marks -- 
Well, he's a gentleman!
You're sweet.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
Then, it's all over?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
Next week.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Why not?
There was -- there was.
What is this insolence?
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
Yes, the police must be called.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Have I kept you waiting?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What do you want with her?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You're a thousand percent right!
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Roy? He's always crying.
Hah.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
What is?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
Lead on.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
I guess I owe you my life.
How come?
No. That was the point.
You, too, Roy.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
Just a few bucks.
I'll get it.
Never.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
I don't?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
This time...
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
You're too young. You should be in school.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You ain't seen nothin.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Upstate.
Atascadero.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
I saw her.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Ate the gun. Oh.
Not many.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
I like a woman who takes control.
Where?
The cemetery...
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Just get on the bus.
That would work.
Why not?
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
I have to pee.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Shit, Linda!
Thanks!
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I've come to help your family.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Kara, no!
It's not working!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Stay away, Sam.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
A bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
You know what gets me?
You ever own a motorcycle?
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
How do you know that?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Me?
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Our pleasure.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Are you--
I'll see.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
I don't know.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Damn.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Please--
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're wrong.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
If he thinks he's man enough.
Honor, I suppose.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Where's the bullet?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
I came back.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
There's a certain amount of information there.
Correct.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Now who's being cruel?
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
You hope.
I've struck my blow.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
No!
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Alice is dead?
For what?
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
I heard you were looking for me.
Premature ejaculation.
That is sad.
I don't care what she wears.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Stay home tonight!
How did she lose her feet?
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Don't know.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
My father!
Doing what?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
That's the XKE.
They didn't murder me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Or get eaten alive.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Yes, we do.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
What are you doing?
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yeah.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
How important do you think sex is?
I can stop if you want.
They are the same.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Like what?
It's just a name.
How did you find me?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Ratan!
I don't know nothing, man.
It's an investment.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Oh.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Then whose name is it registered in?
What kind of a car is it?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Yearse!
Oh.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's very interesting.
Well then.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
That's a nice teapot.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Just one of those. 
But this is public property.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Thank you.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
But I don't play anything.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Okay.
With Life.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Well, don't go.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Mother.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
No. Like this.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Why?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
None at all?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
That's right.
ZAT!
Oh sure.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Oh yes. That's fine.
We have no more surprises.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
It's coming.
What?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
WHY?
What are you talking...
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
Me?? C'mon --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
My job.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Not hungry.
Red, I --
Doesn't sounds like him.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
That you feel that way about me.
Two steps back, please.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Julia's my second wife.
I have to speak to my father.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.  Oh yes.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I said: don't look.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
What?
Tell me, damn you.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I saw everything.
O.K.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
No.
Maybe I will.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
You will keep in touch.
Call me tomorrow.
Really?
Sure.
Gone?
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
It's late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Will you GO, damn you?
You gotta be kidding me.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
We'll do it next Monday.
Oh, so what's the point then?
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
My band.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
He's not worth it!
Nice friend.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Hey Rob.
Huh?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Think about it, Rob.
My house?
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Just the obvious stuff.
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Yeah.  Great.
Fine.  One.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Have you slept with him yet?
You do, huh.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You don't ever think about other people?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You know I'm a good person.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
What?
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Okay.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
No, but...
More confident, maybe.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
You're being stupid.
Nothing.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Ha.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Not really.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Well, you've asked.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yes.  You?
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
How's the store?
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
I'm Vince.
Go to hell.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Yes.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Not your concern.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do _nothing_!
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
That's impossible.
Just a little crazy.
Yes.
He knows about you.
That's insane.
Not the same.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Thanks.
Four?
What were you doing in Felton?
Yeah.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You always were hard to impress.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
What?
Again.  Try again.
It's like to kill me first.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Kiss me.
No doubt.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
We have no understanding.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
You're insane.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Get up.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
It doesn't.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
What?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Exactly!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Yes, wasn't it?
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Oh, yes. Here it is.

That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
So long.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Out of the mouths of babes.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
You -- you --
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Thanks...
Afraid? I should say not!
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Never mind that. What's the story?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Okay, Walter. 
What tickets?
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
I'm finished.
What did you do with her?
You been in a fight?
Was she? Did you notice?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
Me, too.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
I'll have it in a minute.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
I can't complain.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
What do I know about Williams?
With a bag of marshmallows.
After all I've done for you --
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
An attempt to ruin us!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Give me that!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Keep away!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Shut up, you!
Huh?
For heaven's sake, why not?
But how do I know...?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
What's he want?
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
What's that?
Do you know any swear words?
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
Ask her yourself.
It's easy. I've done it.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Where?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And the bride.
You joined up.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
That's it.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I wish it could all have been different.
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
How long?
And now we're glad you did.
Yikes.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
I was just wondering.
What?
You shouldn't a done that.
Now, what makes you think that?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
How awesome?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Tasted pretty good.
Is that all... think real hard.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Help, help us.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
You find something, Georgie?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
You said it, not me.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Gabrielle.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
When you were a little French girl?
Fine.
Very well.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
But I like being human now.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Oh, Rosie.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
No biggie.
Fifteen.
What?
He looks perfectly fine.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Lila...
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Yahoo!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
You tell me.
All I want's the money.
I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Man named Turk Baker?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Tell her what?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Fifty per cent?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Get with what?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Fine, thanks.
Can I sit down?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Why?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
I love you.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
A week? A year?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Thousand dollars a game.
You lived like this once.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
What about... now?
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
What do you mean?
Have you looked inside?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I guess you could say that.
Okay.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
The State Police.
Hide the car.
Oh?
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
Cool.
A toast to the end of the world.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Dad, don't start.
That's okay. You're driving.
They don't know this.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You punched the President in the face?
David, you're drunk.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
We're being exterminated.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
It had been deemed classified.
He's doing a good job.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Sorry for what?
Dick-weed.
He's my angel.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
It's all fuzzy.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Yes.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
What is it?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Alexandretta. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
How dare he?!
I usually don't either.
In that case, I permit you.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
My father didn't want it incinerated.
You do.
It's important!
I'll never forgive myself --
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
Dad!
What?
Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
I'm out, Dad!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Dad, how can you?
Very well. I'm here now.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Dad, we're well out of range.
A long time to wait.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
Just a routine inspection tour.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
No.
You will go to palace there.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
What?!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
It's starting to let go!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes, they believe you.
Who's you?
Al.
This candid camera?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Who am I?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yep.
Why don't you?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'll sue.
Who did?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
I'll get in trouble.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
The beach.
Just get there.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Eat it?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Which language?
...Rene...
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
This...is not going to work out.
Not her. You!
You got any books in there?
I don't know!
Osaka?
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
I told you, I have a feeling...
Probably.
I've got an idea.
I don't know.
Where've you been?
Looks like you can have all you want.
About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Yeah, sure.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
Don't give her your name.
Dieter?
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
Newer, more powerful design.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Enough ROmance.
And how do you service foreigners.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
It may have been affected.
Oh...that's okay.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
We're here.
Don't you want to get out?
Who?
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Just give me the keys.
Yessir...very good sir.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
Dinner...tonight.
Let you leave without it.
Yes, of course.
Can I help?
Trans Ocean Travel.
They left. I had to go with them.
Who else is interested in me?
No.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
You think I'm like that?
And Dieter.
And you?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I asked him.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Her?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
It will be fine. You have another.
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
Yes.
Perfectly.
No?
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
Okay.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Sure.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm afraid you are.
Before you go...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Okay.  Lowell?
Yes... Jeffrey.
Yes.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Alright.
Yeah.
Lowell.
Alright. What did you think?
Like what? Your sign?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
ABC...?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I can't say that!
You're gonna get your fix...
It acts as a...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Here. Got pictures.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
I had no idea until after, but --
I just want to make sure that you both --
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Triple!
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
We rest, Your Honor.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
He's the wrong man.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
So, that's good, right?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
But you don't agree?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Thank you.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
I know.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I have a surprise for you.
I bet.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
That's marriage.
I fell in love Miles.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
It's not something I wanted either.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
He has a reputation for being tough.
So where are you now?
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
I don't know. I can assume...
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Nothing?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
What the fuck...?
HA!
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
How is she?
No—no. What the deuce do I want to—
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
That's an evasion.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I might.
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You only met him once .
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
Who is he?
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Any others?
Amateurs!
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
You win!
Driver!
What am I going to do now?
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
My ticket?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Not at all. 
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
The pleasure is all mine.
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like this. I have no robe.
Here—take mine.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Nope. No complaints.
Must be the Spring.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
You always want to run everything.
I'm following you.
Okay. Hang on to these.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
We don't need forty cars.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
A black eye. 
Darling!
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yeah, swell.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Sorry, Miss.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Just your imagination.
Yeah!
Huh?
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What?
Mebbe.
Yeah.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
No, I'm not...
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
...give me protection?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
What about Ruby?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
There were admirals.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
No.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Some people would say you're paranoid.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
You have other information?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
How'd you know where he was?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
You're serious?
In cash.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Sure.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Black's fine.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're not old. You look great.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
And is that it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Uh-huh.
Why?
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
Not after they're dead.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Are you scared of me?
What if I plead guilty?
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
You planted that shit on me.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
You ever see him sell guns?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
What are you doing?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
That would be one point of view.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Uh-uh.
Gimme one anyway.
What were you two fighting about?
I knew it.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I need to talk to you alone.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Where at?
Four years?
About five years ago.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
You live with him.
All right already.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Are you serious?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Guess where I am?
So we on the same page then?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
She believed you?
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
How long was she in there?
Where you shot her.
Pull the car over.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You gonna tell me who it was?
Watcha gonna see?
Have fun.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
You have it with you?
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
What does she do for you?
Beaumont worked for you.
Was she?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
How'd you find me?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
In a way, yes.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She's all alone.
You better be, motherfucker.
You know it's for you.
It's all been a dream.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
Are you all right?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
Used you?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
A couple of weeks, I think.
Who?
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
It's freezing.
I don't want to know.
Go to sleep.
Your back? Did you fall?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Don't ask.
Yeah, but for what?
I must have been out of my head.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Why do you bring her up?
Where are we?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
How high is that?
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
He said you didn't have one.
I want to know. You tell me!
Are you out of your mind?
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
I'm not upset.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where are they?
So why tell me now?
One drop?
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I don't know what to say.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
You got a nice tan, though.
Push 'em back.
We're doing everything we can.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
I just need to talk.
Who is?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Is he all right?
Pour it in.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Get out of here!
What?!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Two more charges to go.
Thorgan, suit up.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Thorgan? You coming?!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I don't know!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Med-kit?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Let's just get out of here.
You're leaving me here alone?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Barbie from hell...
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
No! He's coming with us!
Nanotechnology.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Are we locked down?
More soldiers?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
What?
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Who's driving the boat?
Where...?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
He's taken him!
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
My kids were on that beach...
Swell.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
You from around here?
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
I'm okay...
Ever see one like this?
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I don't know...
Oh. That's a relief.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yeah. That was me.
I try really hard, actually...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
What are you talking about?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
What do you play?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
You mean like couples?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Or stage parents!
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
What?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
That French ain't it?
Is it hard to learn?
Could I try that?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Brian.
Now why is that?
You wanna hear mine?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Thank god!
A... I gotta go.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Lighten up...
How do you know that?
Then try again, 
Siesta.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Could be.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
How?
What do you want?
You think?
Den less go Joe.
Unzip my pack, yo.
Right.
Who?
Oh. You like her?
Right.
Shut the fuck up.
Yeah probably.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where is he?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I had a female vagina last night.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Right now?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Bang up stuff.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I wouldn't believe it?
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
I gotta find him.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
Whah?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
It's me. Telly.
You want a wip-it?
I can't man.
Yes.
What do you want?
Homesearchers.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Just like who?
I've figured out the message.
No!  Wait!!
Very good.  How did you know?
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
He already did once.
Why did he what?
My cheering section.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
Any sign of rape?
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
What did he mean by Huxley?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
That's got to be it.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Sounds very violent.
That's a very personal question.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
No you didn't.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
That's not fair!
No.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
That's worse.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<u>What</u>?
Where is the Fortress?
Yes.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
The Fortress moves?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
The Beast will kill her.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
I can. Because I choose it.
Saddles.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
What business?
What else is left for a man without friends.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
How did you know I had sons?
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.
A small house.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
And mine goes with you.
Would you desert your friends?
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Then he will die!
Freylag's stronghold?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Yes. We lost five.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Many have perished in that maze.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
You lie!
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Good.
Huh... 500 meters?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Whoever.
Perfect.
Why?
I never rent my gear.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
A little...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Yeah, what?
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
I have no fear.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Huh?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
How long does this... Mania last?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You do?
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish it?
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
You've just decided, is that right?
It'll make it.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
Good.
About my love for her.
Jumped where?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Yes.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
What do you mean?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I guess I do too.
OK... whatever.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Me neither.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
I know that...
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How much, do you think?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
But it's a top three school --
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I can't tell you.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I loved him!
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Was she carrying a weapon?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
So?
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Not yet.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Are you sure?
What, like on va-kay?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
Of course.
I completely agree.
Uh -- sure.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Where?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Purely a precaution...
We go out, smash 'em now?
You're magnificent.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
I see...
Or looked so beautiful...
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I didn't know... I --
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
No... I... I need to rest.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Beware.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Jack, don't!
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
There's the way, mates.
It bodes evil.
The chill is worse this night.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Easily spoken...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
Sunlight, you say?
He'll not escape me.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
They'll do nicely.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Or perchance...
Be patient.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
They tricked you.
He did run?
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Biting you?
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Only that?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Do I not please you, Jack?
You... you... you mortal you!
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
May God protect you.
You follow.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
Mom said I should.
He seems lonely.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
No.  That's okay.
You'd hate him for the trick.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
And if I enclosed it?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
I'm not.
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I don't know.
I almost saw Catalina.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
I like how it feels not to feel.
I'm telling you now.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
To hide a black eye.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
I still don't know what that means.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I can die trying.
Three.
It's okay.
Because Dad left?
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
He doesn't answer.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Why call me?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
The first and the last.
What have you been before today?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Peter left me yesterday.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Don't even...I'm there.
What are you doing home?
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
I guess I could teach you some things.
I didn't go in your room.
He's a big one.
Not for me, it ain't.
She's alright, isn't she?
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Here!
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Start your job? What kind of job?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Why didn't you take it?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What'd you say?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
I'm sure it don't.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Say what?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
I know people.
What am I gonna eat?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Him?
Crawfords.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Crop duster.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
Don't touch that car.
What'd you say?
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
I'm all right.
'Preciate it. Claude.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Jenny?
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Don't do it!
Noon...
Sure, why not?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Yeah, you do...
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
That pain is hunger.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Well, let's rock and roll.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Definitely.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Coulda been much worse.
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
By she, do you mean he?
So I followed him...
You keep a bat under your seat?
You think I'm a tourist?
The South.
Really?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
No.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
..."The Devil?"...
East Rutherford.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
It'll be all right...
Up there.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm fine...  See you...
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm Mary 2.
No.  Just no.
Well then...?
Not about that.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
You're sure you don't want to try?
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
You're not going, are you?
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Uh-uh.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
And yours.
I doubt it.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
Oh, my...
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Not yet.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Pile in.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Hi.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
His physical condition.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Who was the man?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
My... My head.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I like to laugh, Fred.
A videotape.
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Sorry... I...
Sure. Sure I do.
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Well, what do you know about that!
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I beg your pardon.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Gold. You were going to—
Over by that hill.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
When are you going to start?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Oh, good heavens, no!
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Well, it must have taken–
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No porters here!!
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now—
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Right, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What's she got to do with it?
She's going with me.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on! We're wasting time!
A man whose life was empty!
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I'm so glad.
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
English!
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Yup.  Sure is.
Sir--
Sir, you can't just--
You heard me.  You two, especially.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Do his job.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Nope.  Nothing at all.
The what?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Where's he making his big speech?
Oh shit!
Agatha...
He'll turn around.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Oh, Jesus...
Yes, you did.
You set your patients on fire!
I can't even stand up --
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Tuck in your shirt.
In the middle of the night?
And who the hell is that?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You're kidding, that's today?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Run the subscription list...
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
She's a precog?
So now I need you to hack into her.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...
NO!
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
I'm a little dizzy...
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You don't seem all that proud.
You're talking about the precogs...
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
-- and then walk out.
Which one is that?
He's dead, Lara.
Then how did he --
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
They're everywhere.
How many?
Who?
Yes.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
What are you talking about?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
You're Bobby, right?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yeah. Take it.
All the suites are about the same.
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Somebody's getting comfortable.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
We used to take baths together.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Bullshit.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Oh, please.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Get your hands off of her.
Well, you look it. You win?
I didn't say that.
I don't understand.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You vouch for him?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Traveling light. I like that.
Yeah.
Ruiz isn't here.
Thanks.
What about boxing?
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Bye.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Seat belt.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
She really liked the kitchen.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Great. On my fucking room.
Oh really. Why's that?
Fuck...
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Yeah. What vibe?
He woulda told us right?
You fucking nuts?
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What's up?
We're getting whacked.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
You want us strapped, don't you?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Why?
Eighty.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
Bobby and Ricky.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I didn't do anything --
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Cool. See you later.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
You strapped?
No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Come, now. You just got here.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Yeah.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Edinburgh.
Nnnnnnn!
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Okay, okay.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
I can handle it.
Are you?
I know.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
Because you're in trouble.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Now you come back.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
You better believe it.
Me?
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I ain't doing bad.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
So what do I get in return?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where does he live?
Deal.
[Si.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Ordered by who?]
[I believe you.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[I want you.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
And what if amateurs try it?
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
So you were unhappy?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
You need to practice.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Yeah. Two or three.
That's not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Then be trained.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Never.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
It's Creasy.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[No. Why?]
When?
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
You do?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
He has to go.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
And they took that away.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Your son Marty?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Nothing.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Tomatoes.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
You not ugly.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Sure.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
What didn't you like about her?
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
That's all right, that's all right...
Sure, sure.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Where?
Hospital.
Epidural hematoma?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
What the hell's going on here?
You make a mean martini, kid.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
What's that?
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I can't... couldn't.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
I think we could still have a chance.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Maria...
I didn't mean with me.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
You think he won't.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
You really say the cutest things.
Yeah!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
No, never in the slightest.
That. It's out of the act.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
Yes, sir?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
I can try, sir.
What's that, Henry?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Nice.
Arterial silk.
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What letter?
Oh!
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
What bonus?
Sorry.
Oh.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
Well, maybe you're right.
Oh!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
That's—
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Go out and find her!
Look!
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Who?
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, you are.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
She isn't?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
SWAT wants to go in.
Yeah, okay.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
You want me to go up with you?
Good. I don't want to be late.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Johnny who?
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You'd never been out of New York?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Fine.
We lost.
He's cutting down the visibility.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Define concern.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Roper...
Yes, I believe he has --
To live forever.
About what?
From the dream.
Then what?
So wrong --
Not real?
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
-- Yes.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Katie was digitized.
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
Realize?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
-- Standard.
Access established.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
They're called squirbs.
It will not harm you.
Stylin'!
I've never been this sore in my life.
... Let's take a look over there.
What does that mean?!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Quack like a'duck!
GO IVAN!!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Awwh, Charlie.
But ya got a Boss.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Scared.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Long as Charlie says.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
For being a man.
I must be going.
Something came up.
Have you thought about this?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Who'll make the rules?
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Might as well put the time to use.
They don't give a shit about us!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Ya piss like a man.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
The kid just called me stupid.
Not stupid. Fat.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
I turned him down flat.
Masseria's been after me too.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Wanna know what I think?
Jesus.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Best we got.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
I didn't say anything.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
Behind the books.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
... Manly?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Never.
It couldn't be.
Would you settle for a husband?
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
That's taking place outside now.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Waiter!
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Any time.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
No--not offhand--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
What is it?
Taylor, my dear.
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
How do you feel, champ?
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
The--head?
Is *what* getting me down?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
It does!
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
No, Jeff--please--!
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
I know--but you--you're going to help.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Committee.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Yes, yes--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Why?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Saunders--!
Saunders--
Wait--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Splendid.
Well--I--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Well--I have got *one* idea--
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Okay. See you here.
Oh, now--that won't do--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
What do you mean?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
He's lost complete faith in me--
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Just a minute, Joe!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Some people like it.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Deeds?
Yes.
And sings.
Any children?
Yes.
But they did take place?
Yes, but I—
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What are they going to do?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that—
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Let's just walk, okay?
Are you? When?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Have lunch.
Did it?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
With pay!  She is out the door.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Shhh!
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Yes, but you said—
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yes, sir.
Me sir?
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Proceed.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb—
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Shut up!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
We own an opera house, don't we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Ja.
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Oh, the poet? Where?
South Dakota - but on the top.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
I just wanted to make sure.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Really? You think so?
Uh-huh. What are they?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Why's that?
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
And the experiment is in here?
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I've had my moments.
Yes.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pretty piece of land.
...And?
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
You're right, as usual. See you.
I'm trying.
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
I think you know what I mean.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Even if you don't think it's real?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
What?
Really? What would it take?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Where was this?
What do you want me to see?
Uh-huh.
Really?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
It's just a thought.
Definitely.
I can tell you anything else.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
But look at me now...
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
No... no training.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
When?
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
In the desert? What for?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Sounds familiar.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
That's one way of putting it.
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
You will not believe it.
Try me.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Two hundred pounds.
I would never!
Broad?!
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Oh.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Got it.
I knew you'd know.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
It must have slipped my mind.
Head hunting.
Do I?
So who killed him?
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Let's do it.
Thanks.
Ummm.
Frankenstein!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
You underestimate yourself.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Have you always lived here?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
My heart died a long time ago.
Good point.
But there's still only six of us.
Because that's what it is.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
I'll drive.
With what?
Wait!... Look!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Yes.
No.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Ow.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Mother... it's not what you think!
But how do we get in?
Right.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Proceed.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
And, what a delightful idea!
Cavalry?
Any cannon?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Let me see it.
Yes, I am.
Ah-hh, no.
When you eat him, may I have some?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
That is correct.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
No, sir.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I see.
Thank you.
I'll have the fire built up.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Lisette.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
No.
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?
What are you doing in there?
Yes.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
Why not?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
I know.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Does she deserve anything better?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Let me have it.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Thanks, Unc.
You paid cash?
Good.
Fuck, what's his name?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Okay, plan B.
Still gonna smell it.
Nothing.
What about me?
I will.  When can I come visit?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Yeah, pops!
This is a knock.
Ya'll live around here?
Thanks for the help.
I don't know, Debo.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
'Take your car?'
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Who, him? Just visiting.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
I have a problem.
Who did?
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
What?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
What about the gun?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Forget about it.
No way.
That's right.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
I see. Where is this gun?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Right there.
Come with me, honey.
You're wasting time.
He carried on some; kicked.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Yes! Yes!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
What?
It's a shame!
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Blue men.
Hm?
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Dead.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
Huh?
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
You could save him, little bird.
How old are you?
What's your name?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Where's the money hid.
No.
Can I have this?
O' course.
She turned me out of the bed.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Them kids!
When did I ever?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Used to. Not anymore.
No.
You do?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Okay. Hi, dad.
You don't know he did it.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Sure, but...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
She lived there.
I will.
To bed with you, c'mon.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Yeah, nuts.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
An omelet.
About what?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
That's another thing... it's spring.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
No, that's bad management.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
I must be stern with you.
But, Comrades...
The former Duchess!
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
No, sir.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
It's a real Paris reunion.
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
A day.
Look for yourselves.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Yes, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Business.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
On what?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
In other words you don't know.
Thank you.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
I'll try.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Thank you.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I didn't follow you.
Why?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
Yes, sweetheart. 
Those newspaper people?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Oh, yes.
Huh?
No.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Yes.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Do you expect me to believe that?
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
I don't understand.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is that?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
Where the hell is he?
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Why me?
I figured that out.
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
He wants money.
Why not?
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
There's no secrets here, Al.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
For what?!
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
And if I stay?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Sir?
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
We were working on China.
"National Priority."
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Sir?
Let him finish, Bob.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Thou must.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
No.
Winning?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Elvis I like, too.
Maybe I am.
Of them.
I know ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Not that.  Us.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Is that the truth?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Tomorrow.
Hiding what?
Thank you.
What?
Didn't know there was any.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
You don't know what he thinks.
You ain't heard from him?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
The old boy shot by the highway?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Wasn't no bullet.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Okay.
Yes Sheriff.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
I ain't got the money.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right.
I know something better.
Where does he work?
You expect him?
Airport.
I don't need to talk to you.
Why would I care where you're going.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
You already asked me that.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
...Where you want me to put it?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
The kind with the most poles.
Yessir. I understand that.
That's got two double beds.
I know how he found me.
I'm a welder.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No sir.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
...I... I know what you are.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I better go check on them.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
I gotta go make dinner.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
We were engaged.
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Yes, she is.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Didn't I?
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
That is a skill!
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It's not really a good time, guys...
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
What? Where was he?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
If we're for real?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Beer, please.
That is so right.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You told me how to do it!
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I said 'got it?'
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
- and share one of your graves.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Huh?!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Suckin' away.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
- in the gods - Huh?
Not your...
That don't make no sense!
Aw, that's all right.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
I joined the Navy.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Come over here where I can see you.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
No, sir!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
He was. He died.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Then, I'll see you around.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
No way... Would you?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No! That's not true!
And you turned him down??
Really?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Me, too.
He didn't give you much choice.
I've never had a girl.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
When I'm good and ready.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I know that.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
That's brilliant.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Yeah.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
No problem, but who's Susan?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
It's mine.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I have the gun.
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Keep your voice down.
You're an idiot.
Huh?
I don't get it.
Huh?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Observe.
Why?
The furniture guy?
People.  In the house.
It doesn't work?!
Shaky?
Little bit.  Yeah.
What am I, a five year old?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
On it!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
What are you doing with the gun?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Yeah.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
I don't know. Look around man.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
If you got something to say, say it.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Ain't no one seen him.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
Pride will do.
The hell I do.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Apology accepted.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Not yet.  What happened?
Flanking riders?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Put them away.
Ayuh.
Of course I will.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
That's enough, Ellen.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Good for you.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Yes.
Then come on.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Your cairn.
It's Ellie's cat.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Boy overboard!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Aye, that'll about do it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
Only a little.
Somewhat.
Because you're a pirate.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Depends.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
It's the right way.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Where did he come from?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Nebbleman.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
What did he want?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happens?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
I don't know.
What did you want my hair for?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
The same thing I suppose.
We lost him.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
You're all right.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Of course I am Stewart.
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Stewart!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another—
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
That's so.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
And the rest of us are truck horses?
I didn't run away.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
There you are—!
Must be my wife.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
What could I be?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
Holy jumping swordfish!
I beg your pardon.
Sure.
It's all right. Bring him in.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Yes sir.
Okay.
I'm fine.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm sorry ...
I don't know.
No I'm not.
Where are you gonna go?
Trust me ...
She won't go out with me?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
No. What?
... How?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Yes I do.
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
You're not allowed to lie.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
As a matter of fact he does.
Nothing?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Sure ...
... Like Prince Charming.
What the hell's going on!
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh no? Let me show you something!
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Yeah ...
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
Really?
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Open it.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
What's the listing?
I don't think I'm going to the party.
...please, I just don't want it....
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Why?
I'm gonna call you back.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
I have no idea.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
It doesn't matter.
...yeah.....
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yes.
-- you said you did.
I have to go.
....this is your mistake....
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
Ok.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
You like her?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You don't think you'll go --
Have a good trip.
Yes.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
I think maybe over a hundred.
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
No.
I cut myself.
How?
I didn't do that.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Please don't do this to me.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
Like a psychiatrist?
You ok?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
So what should I do with the pudding?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Wait a minute --
You have an ATM?
Is this where you live?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I won't.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Good day, Marquis.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
An innocent child is dead.
-- that was lust --
It's a formality; truly.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
And his writing?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You find this amusing, do you?
And place my reputation at stake?
I have.
Of course.
How is the patient faring?
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
I'll pass the word on, then.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Is it awfully violent?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I am not a wealthy woman.
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Sure you can, just--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The actor
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
I'll remember that.
Randolph!
Yeah
Why is that, Louis?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
There is nothing to discuss-
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
That's right
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Not for me.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
This better be good
So speaks the court jester.
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
And what does he see?
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Mank!
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Yes.
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Here's your glove.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
How do you know? You know her that good?
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
What do you mean?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Oh, Jake.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I am answering...
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
No. Open the door.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Goodnight.
Jefferies?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Thanks.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
You think he's getting out of here?
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Where'd they take Lisa?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
It's me.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I don't want to.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's just not the girl for me.
She's only perfect.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
People have different emotional levels that --
How did you know!
I was.
Isn't he a salesman?
Would four of them -- ?
No.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
I think it's enchanting.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What is it you're looking for?
What are you getting at?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
What about it?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
I don't know.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
The same.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
Too close.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
They always live.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Good luck, Buzz.
Chicken?
Okay.
I like you, you know?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
No--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
That's funny!
I'm not hungry.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You what?
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
Say, listen--
I think I know my son.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
I was talking to Jim.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Look--just relax, will you?
Yes, sir.
What's the charge?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Yeah?
We know.
We'll take it!
Not lately.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Come on!
I shot at one of them.
That's a fine way to behave!
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Pretty mixed up?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Where what was.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Well--we're newlyweds.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
It is for me too.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
He hates me.
What?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
We're talking, aren't we?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He'll be dead when he does.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Yeah.
No, no --
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Yes it was all you --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
What the fuck is going on.
Nick --
You're not hearing me here --
No, Nick, no --
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
I love you, Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
I'm almost done.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Yes!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
What'd they call her in high school?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
And I worked there. For a year.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
No way.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Cancer-sucker.
Acid-chewer.
How long ago was your makeover?
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Merlin, I didn't know --
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Aw, Rudy.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NICK!!!
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
Yeah.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
How many employees?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
No, they're not.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
I'm okay.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I can' take you to a hospital.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
I think he's just passed out.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
If we don't, he'll die.
This is what he was doin'.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Maybe he did.
Nobody. The light was bad.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
They're stragglin'.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Why do you think?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
In a fight?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
And meet him there.
Good thing you didn't.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Three men on matched roans?
But I want to stay.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Put on another one.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Then I know my alphabet.
Wife?!
Ha! Right bitch!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Maybe we can study together or something.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
It looks like the furnace.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
I was thinking the same thing.
No. Try a little higher.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
Not in a thousand years.
My child, you're alive!
You could use the grade, huh?
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
What?
Second best.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
You said you hated him.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Bird books mostly...
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
That's nice.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
You bring me such peace...
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Yes, I did.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
FUCK YOU! 
GODDAMN YOU!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Right here!
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Yes you are.
Now, here's a babe!
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
How much have you got?
I ought to know.
She showed me a drawing.
Why?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
Good night.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Why wait?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I don't think that's so revealing.
Devil worshippers!
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I have to go —-
What's wrong, Mary?
Well, since, you're over twenty one——
It might have.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I don't believe it.
She's not been here for a long time.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
False alarm.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
You mean like "time flies"?
I feel like they do.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Aren't you?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
Not really.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
About sex?
What about sex?
Yes.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Then do it.
Why?
Yes.
Yes.
So you lied to her?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
And you feel the same way with John?
No, you're not.
That's very flattering.
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Not entirely.
Yes.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Why not?
You did that?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Mmmmm...
Are you having an affair?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Not very often.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Let me talk to him first.
And what?
And... do whatever it is you do.
I just thought it might --
Why not?
Well, why?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Apparently.
But why did you want to?
It does not.
Thirty-two dollars.
I just want to know why you're here.
She still is.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Talking.
Nothing.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Prettier than Ann?
He doesn't have to tell me.
I'd like to make another tape.
No.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
You are scum. I'll be there.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I want to see you.
What's so stupid about it?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
It'll just be me.
What do you mean?
No.
Goddamit...
All right, jesus.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Do I get a kiss?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Who was she?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
A wreck.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
What do you mean?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
Me?
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
What does he know about it?
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
Surely.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
So I guess that's it.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
That's what people say.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
It does. Feels right.
She is very hot.
Fuck you.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Beautiful.
She what?  When?
I want to go home now.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Shut up. Shut your face.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Count me out.
I will.  See ya!
Okay! Jesus!
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
I SAID OKAY?
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Hold on.
That was quite a day yesterday.
No, I'm okay.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Whatever. Sorry.
Why don't you come in?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Goodnight, Miles.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
So what's happening with your book?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Both.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
No dad!
Don't touch him.
You love walks.
Good.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I heard.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
What are you doing?
It's getting stronger.
They tell you everything in this book.
Dad.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
The footprints.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
No.
Six months.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
That's it.
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You haven't got any money.
Who?
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Howdy.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
We'd rather stay.
Where's Emmett now?
This is a lot of money.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
So-called?
Here he comes right now.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
I'm ready for that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
I am telling the truth.
Spare me.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Viktor, you should have said something.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
I do?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I have to talk to her.
You look so, so...
Is that a problem?
You don't secretly want the attention?
How about the nudity?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You can't.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
What's that?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
She still with Kent?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do okay.  How about you?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Don't you?
Why?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller?  What?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Yes.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Dr. Crowe.
You use needles?
No.
You hate him?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Yes.
No gas... Hey, that's good.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Never mind.
Don't fail me.
You weren't a paper champion.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
What happened?
Maybe.
Really?
Lots of things.
Yeah.
They did?
They want me to do things for them.
They talk to you?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Could take a little while, though.
Two.. maybe three days.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Hi Suze.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
People say he was a murderer.
-- It's not me!
Not while you're driving.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Bill, we need to talk!
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
No, Starla! No!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Out.
Okay.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Last year, this was a new rig.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Driving, talking to me...
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
You could've asked.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Uh-oh.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
That's me.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Bandit?
Redneck heaven.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Go head on, breaker.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
Chickenshit money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
-- so you shut them off?
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Ww... uh...
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
You woulda?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
...About what?
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
I said I got his machine.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
What are you doing here?
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
...So you made another deal?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Yeah... Sid?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
-- never in a million girl --
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
I can trust Rheya.
A puppet.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Rheya.
Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
I'll just be a minute.
I want you inside me right now.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
But then I would be dead now.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
He won't.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Sooner, the better.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Very nice.
I do care about you!
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
... Don't explain.
"For"...?
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Your what...?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I just sat and listened.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Be nice.
No…not really.
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Lemme down, bugface!
Get away from me, freak!
Frmpph-yrr.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
He knew.
I-- uh--
Thank God.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Hurry up, Flash!
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
I'm here...
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I'll introduce you.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
No!
I left a paper in my desk.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
Bonkers.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Any news on Dunbar?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Not you.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Interesting.
You should live so long.
It's a mouse trap.
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
You want Betty Grable!
What's the award?
You're teasing me again!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
It's that song, Harry!
Anything else?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Good.
Borscht?
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Right.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
You can tell Father Murray to --
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
What did you say?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Here. Take them.
Not particularly.
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Please, please.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
And what would that be, sir?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I always do.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
No.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
The thought had crossed my mind.
Thank you.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Locate.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
... Fascinating.
Underground deposit?
David --
Not exactly.
Why?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
I don't understand.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Why would you do this...?
Close... There --
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
But, why?
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
What must I do?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Yes, my lord!
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
All true.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Uh -- what are they?
Exactly. Happy birthday.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You know what she'll say...
There's an air-lock.
What do you want with us? I demand --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I see. Helmsman?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
How soon --
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Is that what you came here to say?
They're still running with shields down.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Raise the shields...
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Aye, sir --
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Best we could do in two hours.
Steady as you go...
The ship -- out of danger?
Spock...!
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Trying, sir!
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
You do this -- for friendship?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Cramps.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Fundoscopic examination --
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Can you protect us?
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I buy that. What about him?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Just lucky, I guess.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
But Kirk...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
... You have a point...
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
How do you know this...?
... Simple logic.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
I will, Admiral.
... Aye sir...?
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Put them on screen!
Mr. Sulu?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
... Yes?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
For someone so young.
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
Really?
Sometimes I do.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
For what purpose?
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Data doesn't breathe.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Another time.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
Scan for lifesigns.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
I don't believe it happened that way.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
If it works you mean.
On screen.
Eject the core.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Beam him out!
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Gorch?
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
We have to find shelter...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
You should feel right at home with them.
But it's comfortable.
... I believe you...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
Activating injector assembly.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Are you saying they won't help us?
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
You think they're still up there?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Huh.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Nothing.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Still think we're finished?
No way.  You see this?
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
We were until your torpedoes!
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
You tell them, Lieutenant.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Krandog aranty.
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Kronos, sir?
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
Confirmed, Captain!
We've been ordered to -
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Visual!
I know precisely where he'll be.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
You're working late.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
To happy endings.
To new worlds...
Sorry, sir.
On my way.
I am not.

Thank you.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.

Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
That's an order, Commander.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Who was it?
A coup d'etat?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
I have dissolved the Senate.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Looking up at the stars.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I see more than what you are.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Let's go.
Seven minutes.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I came this far alone ...
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Neither did I.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
Oh shit!!!
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
You're not hearing me.
I just retired.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Good.
That way.
Smile... good?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
I...
You want to try it?
You didn't even see it.
Why?
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
Can I have the gun?
What?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
I understand.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I will go. But not you.
Come on.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
No one's traveling in this weather.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Horses.
I understand.  Thank you.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Slow down, slow down.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
I did.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
It was a man though... right?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Just not the eyes.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
He has his uses too.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What else you got?
Who was just here?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Commissioner Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your existence.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Fumitsu.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
It was a tough call.
I guess.
No, it's not.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Right.  That explains it.
Anybody talk to the press?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
You know, you ever think about other women?
Yes.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
MyDick.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
Five months. I love it.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
What did you tell him?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
And nobody else can do that?
You were right. He found me.
Does one exist?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Zero killed them all?
You? You went by the book?
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Koessler?
I don't...
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Are you calling Her?
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Tell me about it...
How?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
What what? What advantages?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
...And she's with someone else.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
You want this in black chips.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
It's a rebound.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Me too.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I mean, I need the money.
I didn't mention her once today.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What'd you get?
Oh.  Where is this place?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I got to at least try once.
I'll be your winger.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
VEGAS.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
She smiled baby.
You gotta do it.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
That was so demeaning...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Baby, we're money.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Selling scrap metal.
No. Doesn't that suck?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
...through the kitchen...
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...How novel.
...It's on.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
What was cold about it?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
True.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
...it's definitely on.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
How bad will it be?
Sure.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
But you needed a drink first.
And this?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Where are you going?
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Mama, no.
I'm German-Irish.
Right.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Did he give you his politicians?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
He'll be OK.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
To the city.
I won't panic.
A million times.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
And all his works?
I do wish to be baptized.
Be patient.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Did you speak to my father?
It's vile.
Okay.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
That's funny.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Well we certainly know that's true.
No!
What club?
What are you talking about?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Sure.
What are you doing?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Far cry from New York.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Bird. That's jazz.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Sure.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Dickie?
And you, sir? Any better?
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I think we sort of found each other.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Right.
I know.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Beating you away.
What?
You know what -- I am.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Hmm. C'e questa... 
And tomorrow?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He says so many fiancées.
I'm fine.
Was who Meredith?
And don't forget. I have the key.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
What about Ripley?
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
How much to get a permit to carry?
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Sure.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Just what?
This I gotta see.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
A real skunk.
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
For a fee.
For a fee.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
You carry a piece? You need one?
I don't like my real name.
That's a nice name.
I musta been stoned.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Do I look like a narc?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Yes.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Age?
Education?
So I hear.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
Your name Sport?
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Whatever happens.
I wish you were coming with me.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
That always used to work.
Why me?
And why not?
I'm sorry.
Oh...
Exactly.  And he got good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
No, sir.
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
A statement?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Did you... did you...
The G-man?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sandra Sinclair.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Thanks.
Wish I could say the same thing.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
So, it is a blacklist.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
What?
It's about me.
Oh...
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
No, not really.
Yes?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
If you have some, I'd...
How'd you happen to come here?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
A trifle.
And what had you done?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Cathy!
No!
I don't think your mother would like that.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Is she all right?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Where does he live?
Yes, but where?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
It's a surprise, you see.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
The little girl's name.
Yes.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Shall I call the doctor?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
They're back!
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
How long have you known her?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
And if you don't?
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I'm awfully sorry.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
How do you know Annie?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
You are, aren't you?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes, but...
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Like what?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
With my little sparrow leading team.
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Not if they're starting a war.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
It is a pity.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
But Richardson?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Don't call me that confounded name.
I am the best man for the job.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
The same. Look here, Gray --
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I come from Lisbon.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
I think we should get some support?
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Who are you?
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
No...
So you're going to kill him?
My father.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Could say that.
But you, you've had them.
Honey. I just can't.
I don't believe you.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
What do you mean, dear?
Tell me what?
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
Just Klaatu.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
About five months -- your months.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
Is it real?
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Goodnight, my dear.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Can't stand light?
We don't ride with vampires.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
Zero.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
The meanest!
That's right.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
What?...
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Lots more where he came from.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
Ocean air!
You've heard this story before?
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
When?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
No.
Don't bother.
The Marines.
Huh?...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Watch Clark.
It's shorted out or something!
Cut him loose?
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
He's gone already!  Do it!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Damn you, MacReady!
Nothing we can do about that.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Well, get to it.
Well, stick to it.
Don't let up, Childs!
I am going after them.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Bet the last place you ever go.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
What else can they do?
What kind of stories?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Do you know where they live?
Why did they built it?
How are your dreams now?
I won't leave you like this.
Created?
How do you control the Morlocks?
How?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I -- what are you?!
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
What?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Admiration?  My my.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Alex, it's just the zoo.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
So it's astronomy now, is it?
I've seen it.
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Perseverance.
Your husband is dead?
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Why not?
Yes.
Yes!
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Or mud carriers.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Mara --
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
No!
Do you have it?!
Here?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Why?
I suppose so.
We choose to believe it.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're inside --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
I'm fine.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You killed him?
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
He didn't either.
They should just be looking harder.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
How?
I still don't either, even after all these years.
[Beat] We will.
You have no idea what's going on.
This has nothing to do with that.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Who told you this?
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Don't you go to jail for that?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] Thanks.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Hon?
What?!
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
You girls are in some hot water.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You want to come on in?
A .38.
Louise is alright.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
What the fuck is going on?
Not yet.
Okay.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
I'm choking on it.
Oh yeah.
In the back?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Maybe.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma kinda took to him.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Yes, Thelma?
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
We can change our names.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
What are you talkin' about?
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
So you admit it?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Loser? You?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Well think about it.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
I don't know what to say.
Got cash.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
No.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Out getting coffee.
Mary.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Thanks.
Big time.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
No thanks.
You own a home there?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Here you go.  What's that smell?
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Well, I'll see ya.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You don't buy what?
No.
You can't be serious.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Surprised?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Healy.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
What are you?
Yeah?
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
I wish.
Shhhhhh!
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
We can't do that, Bobby.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Yes it is.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
He was.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
I, uh...
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I know, I know...
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
You're sure...
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
You're steppin' on sign.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
His spiritual mother...
And...
What'd you expect to hear?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
What?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
We're going for The Stronghold.
We're in there. We're in there --
You didn't have another vision...
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Go ahead, Ray.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Get up!
I'm with someone.
What would?
What are you talking about?
Used to what?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
It's just as I thought.
Anything.
Why?
Well no...inverse order.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
You don't have to do this.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Yesterday.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
What truth?
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
That's three.
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
How could you?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Sir?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
You.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
I'm not losing it again!
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Like what?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long, but distinguished.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Right.
What?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
They should have warned you about that one.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
No. You can be mine!
Nope.
But you continued to fight.
What the hell you doing?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Then why are you here?
No bother.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
I know.
He was by the book, all the way.
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Brunette.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
On his way.
C'mon!
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Harry!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
Come on!
Tell me!
I'm late.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Oh God, Doug.
The hell you're not.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
There's something I have to tell you...
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Oh, since when?
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Aliens?!
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?
Hell you did.  Your turn.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Well, sure.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
That's the plan.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Like hell you are.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
I'm dead. We're both dead.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
The hell you do. At this hour?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
No further questions.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
No. No...
You fucking swear to shut up!
Of course.
Right. You're right.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
...Are you sure we want that?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
...What do you mean?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
That's why I hate experts.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
I followed her from the courthouse.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I lied.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
Exactly what happened then?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
It's okay, Eddie.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Calls for speculation.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Well, where are you going?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Was there an argument?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
A blue rose.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Faulty wiring.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
He probably wanted to drive over.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Well, why not?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
I can't help you there.
But I love you, Laura.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Okay.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
We throw away the whole head.
I'm sorry, Mom.
We're late to get to your mother.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
I can arrange that. I like that.
I don't know.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
No.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Yes.
We went to Code Blue...
...that's all right.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
You're talking like a drunk.
That's what I am.
I...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
No.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The broad has disappeared...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
Huh.
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
But I think I know where she'll be....
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Don't you live at home?
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Have you got a pocket compass?
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
So I don't know about horror.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
No biggie, really.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Just be careful, okay?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Chase, it's Dylan!
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Coming for you...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Really?
Choice?  What kind of choice?
No, not really.  I...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Your father?
Guilty.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
I know.
Anonymous.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Is it true Phil?
I'm pissin' fire man.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
I can't watch this.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
It works?
Who?
It was my fault.  I slipped.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Of what?
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
I know.
Take good care of my son.
It has nothing to do with him.
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
And being sixteen.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
Son of a bitch!!
I don't know...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I can't be sure.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Well... Yeah - okay.
I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...
When did you talk to Lula?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
But I'm wild at heart.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
That don't seem fair.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
She got me an abortion...
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
You do.
Where?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
If you say so.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Come sit by me.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Course I am, mama.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Yes.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
On one condition...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
By who?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
You're stoned.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
She left me. Crabs.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Tripp.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
James? My James? What's happened?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
What's to tell?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
And your wife left you.
Better luck next time.
No. There's no one here.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
No! What gave you that idea?
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
You're welcome.
Yes.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Washed up?
Well done, James.
The bus station.
Carvel.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
You can see the outline of a butt.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
When?
When nobody's looking.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Even if I end up going to jail....
I think so... What about you?
Who does?
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I heard.
What's he doing out there?
Inside.
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Sure it is.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Her husband.
A jockey? You mean, like --
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You want to keep him happy.
Foreman now.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
When can I see her?
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
What's that?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Were you watching me?
I have to go.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Little Red Riding Hood.
I could take you downtown.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
They sound like finches.
Does he?
Yes.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
How do you know?
Yes?
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Why not?
I wish you'd give it a try.
I don't need someone else.
Do you know what "normal" is?
What did you think would happen?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
It was a small house.
It's fucking freezing out here.
Me?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I'll buy a plant.
You must hate it.
Yeah?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Twelve years in prison?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
What?
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
Their power. They seduce me.
Bullshit.
Being here, with me.
Which brother did this?
No you don't.
Where're you?
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
How deep's the drop-off here?
I'm taking you back out.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I don't know how!
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Give me that!!
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
What's the timer set for?
She'll wait.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
That seems to apply to you also...
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
No.
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Nothing.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Why?
But then why did you bother changing?
What do you mean by sensible?
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
We'll try again.
Why don't you try?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Thank you.
Yes.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Agnes...
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
They were stained.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
I don't know.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
I got sicker.
And then what?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
From God.
Do you have any children?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
You have trouble sleeping?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
She'd get angry.
A mistake...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
What did you do?
No...
And then...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
As much as God loves you.
Who am I?
Would you like to tell me?
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I hate them.
Hm hmm.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
A crucifix.
No.
What do you feel?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes, who did this to you?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
I don't know.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Yes... I...
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
Why haven't you asked her?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
There's another choice.
Oh, some time in January.
What is it?
What sheets?
Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
All right?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
You're what?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
You think she's a saint?
This is insane.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Is it because she's a nun?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Then she's a liar.
They are?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Do I snore?
No. I don't.
Of course I can.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Yeah, grotesque.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Something like that.
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
What are you?
Why selfish?
See you.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
What's that mean?
A book!
What?
Is there a fire, then?
I'll look after meself.
But I'm clean.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Ah, go on, you swine.
You wouldn't!
Oh yes.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Don't exaggerate.
What?
Shurrup, cheerful.
Is that you, Roby?
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
No, you'll follow me.
What's up?
Sure.
Don't you remember?
What?
It grows on you.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Right.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
He's running a fever.
At least it can't get up here now.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
My signal's fading.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
About four hours.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
By eating our food supplies.
... More spores coming.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
Kablooey.
Wait a minute.
Oh man...
Yep...
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Do it.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Yeah, I...
Sounds great.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Is that a fact.
Only six?
No!
Give me a yell is something happens.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I am somebody.
Yes. I do.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Just like it.
You know me better than that.
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
I'm a junk yard.
That I am...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Okay.
What?
So she seems.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Okay. Mix.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
It's not nonsense.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Glory Hallelujah.
Groom.
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Also Addison deWitt.
Is that what you want me to be?
I'm for it.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
Like an agent with one client.
How do you mean that?
Don't be dense. The party.
What are you doing here?
You probably won't believe me.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
He's the best.
Hollywood.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
But the raves about your performance-
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
Of course it is.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
No trouble at all.
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Peace and quit is for libraries.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Check.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
That was a pity...
They'd die without each other.
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Not much.
Nothing...
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
What's your being married got to do with it?
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
I placed...?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--a spy, you mean?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
About the past year.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--I haven't said anything--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Haldeman.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Maybe we are...
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Night.
Any idea what he did?
Mind if I try?
Tell that to Muskie.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--Deep Throat?--
--what about you?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
To cover up?
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
Look, I told you inside--
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Security consultant.
Government. Recently retired.
I really want to know.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
I did all right on McCord.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Howard--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
Suck me...beautiful?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
What's that?
What?  We both have cars.
I think I've had one.
What?
Do you?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
It's all good.  Breath check.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Nothing!
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Whatever you want.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
You've got something going?
For me?
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Okay, don't stop.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Just like sex with my wife.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Really.
You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Why the fuck would I do that?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
I told him it wasn't ready...
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Good day!
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
HUH?!
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
I'll never let go!
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Bartok... a question.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Remove him at once.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Young	man, I...
You gave the orders!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
What's your name?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Oh.
Well...
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Why not?
Fifteen years, huh?
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
It's terrific.
Yeah.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
M'hm.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
It relaxes me.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'hm.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
What?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
I'm cool.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
I'm late.
What'd I do?
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Oswald and ghosts.
I can think of another word.
Are you?
Yeah.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
It's a narrow view.
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Mean?
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
How do you like this couple, Max?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
So the colored have enough trouble.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Yes, I do.
I just have time to get the, uh-
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There were many men interested in you?
Absolutely not.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Of course.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Don't you miss it?
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
He's not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Damn straight.
Can I open it?
Just did.  Jealous?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
But she's alright.
And you know our friends, how?
Forget it, Judy.
Oh yeah...
Whatever you say.
Yes.
Hardly...
For good.
I'm going to throw up.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
Otis!
It's not like this all the time.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
It's a shit novel anyway.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I'll do it.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Sally did all this herself?
No you're not.
What?
And Ryan works at home.
I'll be your best friend.
That's a lot of those.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Sally?
Do you need anything else?
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
You don't know she's a bitch.
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Well, something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
You don't need to thank me.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
I'll be right out.
I don't have a drug problem.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
I'm Princess Bala.
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Yes?
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
You did?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Don't get all sappy about it!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Okay, son.
So...you two are in love?
...Not enough food?
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
What did I tell you?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
You mean tonight?
No. Like a man.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Oh, I understand.
How is your cold?
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
This is a bad day for me.
I think so.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
You don't want me here --
I'll fix you some coffee.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Miss. 
Thanks for reminding me.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Sure.
A cemetery?
Cut.
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
No, I don't.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
Shut up and deal!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
That's very flattering.
Think.
The Vice Squad?
What kind of joint are you running?
You better.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh?  Oh!
You too, sir.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Yeah, wasn't I?
What's this -- you packing?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
No.
I'm with you, lover.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Doctor.
I took sleeping pills.
No.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I missed you, Fran.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
I don't believe you.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.
You know I do.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Where are you headed?
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
I like all of them --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby what?
What is this?
North ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Looks that way.
I know.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Would he remember you ?
Ours.
Touchy.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
When did you hear?
Yeah.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
Both of us...
Which one's the Colonel's?
Sure.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
And shut up.
Cognac?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
134  CONTINUED:  
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:  
She's dead.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I was hoping you had some news --
Why?
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
It's a spring day...
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
I already have.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
Fuck you.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Since forever.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
I see the help -- judgement call.
How old are you?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Note. Put it in the note.
Yes.
Okay.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
It was a mistake.
What do you want?
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
He's a pain in the ass.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Well, I can't reach them.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Oh, is he dead?
Well, that's a load off.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Thank you for walking him.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Come on, sweetheart...
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
Does it matter?
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Yeah.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Um, five.
Why?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Better than playing with yourself.
Why?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Where you wanted to be?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Tell me about the first time.
Because I want to know.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
No.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Check.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
We split the money?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I don't believe that.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
Because, I'll take it.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Yes.
What happened to her?
That doesn't sound normal.
Why not?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Why didn't you fade?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
American currency.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Never heard of K-MART?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Who put a bee up your butt?
You're all bloody useless.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
That bad?
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
I could pencil you in if you like?
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Yep, it's all yours.
Okay.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yo, dobree!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Well she sure isn't normal.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Come on, that shit can wait.
Maybe it is!
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
Why?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
I'll tell her you were here.
I don't want his money.
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Me neither.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Now it's okay?
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
It was.
-- Obviously.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'They won't.'
No. Not like you.
So you agree you need help?
Don't bother!
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
You don't know what you want --
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
Where?
Where?
I was twelve.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I'm not tired.
She did. It was you.
That's right. You just act like one.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
Yeah. Maybe so.
No!
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
I'm going to be at the dance.
In the parking lot, with her.
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You did what?!?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Hi, Marty!
You don't mind?
You expect me to believe that?
Okay.
What do you feed him?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Why?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
How about over here?
Yeah.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Yes.
No.
Git.
Who're you?
New Jersey?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
You.  Like the papers all say.
It's kinda hard this way.
Oh, my.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Hello.
Barton!
...Who?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
What else?
Just Bill, please.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
A souse!
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Okay.
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little –
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
And I could tell you some stories –
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
That's all right, really –
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
So they say.
Why don't we go to your room-
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik.
Congratulations.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Huh?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Anyway.
All night?
No?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
No, Nick, please --
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
What did she tell me, Beth?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
About a year and a half.
I quit.
I have nothing to hide.
But you didn't hurt --
That's right.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
It's not the same thing, is it?
To see if he can get away with it.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
No.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
When?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I'll convince you.
Liar.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Yes I am.
What was the weapon?
You don't like punk rockers?
You're my friend, Gus.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
How do you know?
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
I'm not black.
Not black.
Still not here.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Who am I?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Oh – you mean black people!
So then what?
Drugs??!
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Staten Island would be ok.
What's that?
George?
You only want one Big Mac?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
My point exactly.
Yeah.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
That's ignorant.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Treat to be here.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
And the truth frightened her?
Weird, huh?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Yawn.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
You are going back to school.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
I didn't kill your wife.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Then you never loved me?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Actually, he took the car.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Just ones this beautiful.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
I said I'm sure he did.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'm not-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
...Not the bat?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
What are you talking about?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Bruce, you can't.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
What say we flip for it?
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
A man with a death wish.
Here. Get a good seat.
About what?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
The small one.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I wish you'd...
I feel naked without it.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
And what did you say?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Night.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Welsh.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
D.C., Chief.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
I am sitting.
This is going to take some time.
Maybe this is heaven.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
At least we won't have to worry about her.
I know.  I'm sorry.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Wait.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
You can build another one... with her.
We tried.
We need help.  We deserve help.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
About what?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Where'd they go?
I want to get in.
Yeah.
Good girrrl!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!

At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
I think she's in with them.
Let me have it.
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Any particular kind?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Viridian?  What is...?
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Oh, as long as we're here...
Maybe Charles does.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Why not?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I agree.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
Good night, Eve.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Hello, Dennis.
Thank you.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Hello, Sid.
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I see, Ben.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
I understand.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
I can't write.
... Sir?
I never needed money.
It's very sore.
Yes.
Is his back feeling better?
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Compensated...?
... Oh, really...
Yes. I will.
I said - try again.
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
I would appreciate that.
I never played a jewel thief.
Yeah, okay.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
She's very beautiful.
I was worried.
The ferret?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
You bastard.
I'm a puppeteer.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Thank you, sir.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Maxine.
The usual, Barry.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
It better be.
What's he been in?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
Hush, sweetheart.
Can I be anyone I want?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
You bastard!
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
One hour.
Did you see the reviews?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Do you mind?
Oh, Lotte...
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Folks come. Folks go.
That's the last thing they took from me.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
No..No that won't do...
Won't you be late for work?
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
What yard? When who-
It ain't what you think.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Paul D.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Why me, man?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Nothing.
My rug.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
I'm shomer shabbas.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
I thought you might know, man.
Yeah man.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
You mean coitus?
He fixes the cable?
Well--sure, I could do that--
From who?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
So Dieter has the money?
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Oh?
Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey Walter--
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Just for making the hand-off?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
The fucking point is--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hey, cool it Walter.
It's a heart attack.
Wha. . . Donny--
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
Walter--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Who is this?
...Us? DUDE
Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Is this a--what day is this?
Huh?
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Walter!
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Stay away from me, mister!
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
Someday.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
What about Nomak?
Fry 'em.
What?
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
Where the hell have you been?
Too bad you're out of it.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here.  Watching us.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Are we bringing home strays now?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Watch me.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
But I just got here --
It worked, didn't it?
You don't know that.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Blade --
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
You don't look so good.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
What about the chemistry panel?
Sometimes --
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
What happens then?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
--which she may have--
Mrs. Leavitt--
--Christ almighty--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
So whoever built this--
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
You said the name "James."
Then I'm going--
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
I want amphetamines.
--no, I think they're all in there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Something. Someone.
Shut-up.
Try a long walk.
--Cotter: shut up.
Gimme it!
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--Domini!
Goes right along with these two.
--about the Witch--
Right. And the check's in the mail.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
By day? No sweat.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I think it's time to get out of here.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
And what's your excuse for being here?
He'll never know.
Sure. I'm sorry.
Whatever.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
What happened to my Dad??
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
No, I--
Meurice--
What was that?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
What'd he say?
...What do you mean?
Marty.
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
No.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Got a job for you.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Nobody knows you hired me?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
This.
Meurice...
What's that?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Yes.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Why do you do it?
Yeah. I get it.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
If you want to.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
No.
I'll go then.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
That's good.
Whatiya mean?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Yes.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Terrible. boring.
Maybe so.
Where are they?
Yeah. Good bye.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Yeah.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Why not?
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
Yes.
Yeah?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
That sounds great!
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
What?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
What?  Yeah, sure.
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
We want some grass.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Murder.
What kind of project?
Good night.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
No, my brother.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.  You do the talking.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Mom.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
I'm sorry, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Dad.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I didn't mean to...
Because she's visiting me.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
It's true.
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
Not enough.
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Of course I am.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
No -- but I got something.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
That's what my report will read.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
Like cats and dogs.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Why would she want that?
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
What happened after that?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
You called him?
No.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
I thought the subject was sex?
Sure.  Where to?
Is it against the law?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Are you scared?
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Yeah.
Really?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Why did you lie to me?
It was a place to start.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
No -- never.
Oh Jesus.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
No treasure maps, huh?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
No, I don't think so. I --
Well, I'd like to read them.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
I never knew that.
Was this during Betty?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Carolyn!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
She used to be so friendly.
You want me to call the doctor?
Oh, that'll be nice.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
How long you been married?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, really?
Sure.
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
You sound like an artist.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
You drink bug repellent?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
No. I'll do them later.
Yes.
You must get lonely at times.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I told you, I love other people.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
No, I'm just saying --
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
Oh, how is he?
How about if I set the table?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
What?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
What about your husband?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
What happened?
I don't remember!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
How the hell should I know?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
How did you get in here?
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
You know I can't.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Please.  It's for your own good.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Where is it?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
Not that I remember.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Two point one seventy-six.
What's that, Johnnie?
You don't need a key.
Where is it?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Jesus, Caesar!
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
The money?  The money's gone.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
No.
I need you ...
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up!
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Lick me.
Where is it?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah.
Where in the hell is he?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Are they really?
Yeah.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
How did you meet him?
What?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
What was it then?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Who is Gino?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
An accident.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
How'd it go?
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I think everything is okay.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Yes.
I think so.
...they won't let you go...
So now you know.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, sir.
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
No.
-- you could put it together --
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
...omigod, no...
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Who paid the bill?
xxxxxx
Yes.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
Hang on... 
Abbott wants to talk.
I tried.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... new washer.
What? You mean you've got ...
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Well, I ...
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You remember Alison?
Er, I knew you looked different.
What?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
You killed him?
So how ...?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Out of kindness.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Jack ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Every day?
I thought you arrested me.
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
No you're not!
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Where are you going?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
But if they did promote you
Can I forget it?
I know that.
I never signed the form.
What! Shit!
Sam Lowry.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
This is an emergency!
Who's that? 
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Not ... as such ...
Who fixed your ducts?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
Time to go.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
She asked me to pick her up.
I better just go in and see her.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
IB Bangin.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I know him. That's Noel.
I guess there's always a chance.
I think this place stinks.
I'll be right down.
He's better, though, right?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You married?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
She's no whore, Marcus.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
A medical miracle.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
Better bring it all.
Do it!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
You're burned out.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You really think so?
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
There are only ten.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
London.  That's a promotion!
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Okay.
Eventually rising to...
Call if you get weird.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Yes.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Stop it.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
I'll never tell.
Yes.  That's right.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Anchor?
I'll speak to you.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I like "godsend."
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
This is hysterical.
Because you're nuts.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
Yes.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
I'm sorry.
Not anymore!
Yeah.
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
N-no...
Are you a virgin?
Whaddya mean?
Carla...
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Hm.
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
Not only that, he copied us!
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Let's check out the scene.
Well I was uh, just looking...
I didn't buy it I made it.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Uh, sure.
Yeah I did.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Yes, get rid of them...
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Oh, OK.
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Yes!
Amazing!
Would you sleep with them?
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Hi, guys.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Hi.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
'Bye.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Didn't you get my message?
You guys are thrashed.
Hi there.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
He did what he was supposed to.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
What are you talking about?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
I have cheerleading squad.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
They don't even have Dolby.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Thanks.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
Well, I hope so.
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Oh, please.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
God, I never thought of that.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
How can I possibly thank you?
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I'm not interested yet.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I doubt that.
It's possible.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
What's it say?
You a God damn witch?
Will that work for me?
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
I thought I was--
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
What do I got?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
Naw...
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Annie's a smart lady.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Boring.
Then go.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Fear and ignorance.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
It's a league record.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Who ain't?
...he did what he was told.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
A powerful man.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Oh, good.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Matter of fact...
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
Then he called me a faggot.
All right, Ace?
Between...
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
I just told you. She called me.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Well, sir, I was just...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
We can't get rid of him?
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Right?
You sure?
Oh...
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What are you talkin' a- ?
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
With the money.
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I wouldn't do that...
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Don't you threaten me!
I'm not -
Let me in the house! Fucker!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Well...
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
A record of the arrests...
So, you're a righty?
God! 
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Nicky, I did -
Fuckers!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
Oh.
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
And I mean... that's no good.
All right.
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I know what you mean.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
I'll be there.
Bye.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Hm.
Yes, you did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Okay, yeah.
Get lost?
Yes.
God... I wish you...
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
I think that's it.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
So are we.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
What?
They'll do it.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
I'm positive.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Again!
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
You are right. What can I...
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
I wonder..
I'm sure.
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
You're serious?  You'd help me...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
I know.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
You think so?...Selina?
You can't get away with..
Spear.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Yeah, she's okay.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
But I'm blind.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
Any place.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Theo wants to talk again.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Bullshit.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
How much time do you have left on it?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Don't say that.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Did you hear that click?
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
You're going to let them get away with this?
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
Hand me the phone.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
A typical fuck-up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You're enjoying this too much.
Ask them.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
Didn't we play this scene before?
Keep talking.
We can be there.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Talk to the man.
I don't know what you mean.
And not a nickel.
Put the girl on.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Is that good or bad?
So who's he?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
What you think?
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
It's him, isn't it?
She's not that either.
In a way.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Like treacle.
Jimmy?
You on the game?
No, I didn't --
They're jealous.
Why?
Jesus fucking Christ.
As different as it's possible to be.
Want to look after you.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Tell him it hurt --
Ask to meet me again.
Whenever. Tonight.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
Delirious.
Come on.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
What?
Yes.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
Don't go like that.
Died...
In a manner of speaking.
I like you, DIl
Yes.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Yes?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
It's your decision.
A hotel?
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Hope not.
So it's on the street.
I can smell her perfume.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
I didn't even fancy her.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Why did you sign up?
And you play cricket?.
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Stop it --
Hurling --
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
Well -- come on.
Relax -- you're gaining.
Let's look anyway.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Can you remember anything at all?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Of course there is!
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
Then say it.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
But --
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
No, what?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
May I have a cigarette, please?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The last one, please.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
You'd lie about anything.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Open it.
The view had better be worth it.
Me?
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see my passport?
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
I'm not fifteen.
Okay.
That sounds like their problem.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Maybe.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Why?
How often do you go through this little ritual?
It's a start, anyway.
I don't believe it.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
And the last one?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Here's ten.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
What do you want?
I don't know anything.
I'm very cold.
I don't know.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I found it! I found it!
No, Jean-Louis.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Charles is.
How did you find out?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Starting tonight?
Lay on, MacDuff.
I don't think I follow you.
I wasn't --
How do you shave in there?
A quarter of a million dollars.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
What are you talking about?
Words can hurt very much.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
We will separate -- you look over there.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
No.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Not much further.
You never went, uh, all the way?
I thought you'd be pleased.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No. I'll handle this.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
She was murdered?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Why?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
He says he loves me.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Don't you think it's sick?
No.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I'll think about it.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
Did he say anything else about her?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
Just thinking about something.
And she didn't?
Maybe you better just drive me home.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Oh...
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today.  New policy.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Huh?

...-tana.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Would you hurry up, please?
That dog ain't mean.
...town. 
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Okay, okay! 

Kiss my ass!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
You wanna hit me?
Back up!  Back...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
 Shit. 
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Aw, shit  
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Oh, no!
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Not completely, anyway.
...miles.
A-And you  owe me...
You all right?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

 Okay.

Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 
Oh, shit.
 



Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Thank you very much.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Well, well, well.

...help you?
We do need your truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
No, sir.
...-bility.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Let's proceed.
You look fit...healthy...
...that.
Grateful?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Forget about him.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
 But...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...should be right outside.
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Bring him up.

Goddamn it, Ma-...
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...son.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
...colonel?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...try this one out some-...
...the master of his realm.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...to talk, son.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
BLACK BACKGROUND.
Heat's murder.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
'Course you do, Jake.
Thanks.
Who's the investigating officer?
Oh yes.
What for?
No. She's probably scared to death.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
How did you find out?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Yes... I think I can manage...
What are you talking about?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
Tell her later.
That's a filthy habit.
Why?
The apple core?
How do they do that?
I get by.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Certainly not!
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Did he know?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
Your eye.
...A flaw...
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
You bastard.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
I want to see her.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
...where does Kyo live?
Okay...
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Ida Sessions.
Okay.
There's just one question.
I don't understand.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Yes. No.
Yes.
Apple core?
Yeah.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
No, you have a press agent do it.
I'm working for his daughter.
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
We'll talk about that later.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
What does it say there?
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
Oh!
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Who else you been to see?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I know...  But you do look so silly.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
I'm not sorry.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Yes, sir.
Not my wife - not either of them.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'll get you some coffee.
Why, Brad?
What check?
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
I know, but -
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Yes, sir.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
Unnhh!
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
I'll just take the gum.
Sure. Go ahead.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
I think you'd better leave now.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You two better quit it.
Train. It took eight hours.
I can't believe you're here.
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
No.
But you were.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Jesus, you're caustic.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
You have a better suggestion?
I'm just kidding.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
It wasn't me.
Oh God...
Yeah.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
So I'm told.
Peptic ulcer.
Go open the sore.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
She called you Brad?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
I think they were Catholics.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
All of them.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
You hate people.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah, but at what a price.
You know.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
I don't want to talk to you.
You're lying.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
You're kidding.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Make them change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
To talk to you.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
No, she's getting married.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
So.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Actually, that's his night job.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
I'm trying.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
You're kidding.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
Who?
You!
They put up the least amount of struggle.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
What do you mean?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Veronica, I love you...
It stings a little.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
WHAT?
No way.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
You hope what feels good?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye  That was Snowball.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
Where's the radio?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
I don't expect you to understand.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Maybe lead to a flare up...
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Hal knows what he's doing.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
For the same reason you did, to help.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Never
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Do it, goddammit!
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
There is.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Then it's a deal.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Well - I'm back.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Crime?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Yeah... Pete the English.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
What?
The ride is free.
You psychic?
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Of course.
I think...
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Federal?
Very generous.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
No harm done, ma'am.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Of course!
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
You're gonna cheer up.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
I'm standing right here.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Twenty-four minutes.
You prefer nights?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
With what?
The trunk?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
It's a mess.
Play music.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
I can't believe this.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
What you mean, no?
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
The man who hired me for this contract.
In case he asks.
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Yeah, that.
And you believe me...?
Then what are you?
Any special reason?
Shut the hell up.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You bit someone's nose off?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Arf... You gotta help me.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
What is it with you and the space program?
Do they have a secret handshake?
What newsletter?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Pretty scary, huh?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Who are you, Jerry?
Is this your dad?
You watch me, don't you?
What van?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
They're big details, Jerry.
What?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Why not?
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm leaning toward no.
I don't know...
Whatever.
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Working.
You don't understand --
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Anything happening in there, El?
I'm willing to take that risk.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
I disagree.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
You know why I'm here.
With me.
I don't understand.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
And?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Okay, okay... there.
Okay.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Why did you contact us?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
What kind of deal?
That's my girl...  Lights.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
And?
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V.L.A.?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Why?
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
But I made this arrangement --
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
That's good: he earned it.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Cool Hand Luke.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
Yes.  I believed him.
I don't have it...
You already made the delivery?
Where is it?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
I think this is number three...
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
Then what do you need me for?
You're afraid of him.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Why should I trust you?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Go and look for a note.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Who came in after you?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
Yeah, everything's different.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Shut up.
Right.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Did you come?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
You should have gone to the funeral.
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Yes.
I did this already.
It's hospital policy...
Yeah, and a dimple.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I don't want to hear anymore.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Really?
What about the engagement party?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
Come on.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, please.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Don't be fresh.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
By color.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
Anything interesting.
No way.
I don't like lamb.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Sounds grim.
Steak?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Yeah, the plans.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Are you all right?
Something you did?
I think we need to talk about some things.
So, what do you say, Let?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Half the tapes.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
We'll think of something.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Can I trust you, Sami?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
-- Did you set it up?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
You lived there. You know the city.
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
Yeah.   It's mine.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait here.
Where is it, Sophie?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
Glenmorangie is very good.
Something like that.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Yes.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
What do you think?
How so?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
Kneel!
My comb!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Perhaps.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I'm buying.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
No.  I have one more thing to do.
I lost my key.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Not me.
I dabble.  May I?
You're not gonna come back, are you?
She's still dead.
That's ancient history.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Is he inside?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
"Our" Crow...?
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
I don't think so.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
What'cha reading?
Thank you.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Why not?
You don't even know me.
How about tonight?
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
I do not.
I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Hi.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I don't think that bothered him.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Those are my letters!
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Well do you like him?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
It's Kathryn.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I am?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Just taking your photo.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
And then I can go home?
No.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Honey, is something wrong?
Get out of here.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
And you think she bought it?
Where is she?!
Yeah?
What do you mean?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
Who are you spying on?
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
Kind of.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
And that's why you're leaving?
And I don't.
I've never done this before.
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
I have a flair for drama.
Come again?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
And if I don't?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
I'll do that.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
She really loves me.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
I got my wish anyway.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I live right here.
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Voices from an old dark house!
No.
Whenever you want.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
This is more fun than just pretend.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It stands so still.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
But what happened to the little deer?
It got hit.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Good.
Don't you hear it?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Never felt better.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
You're just saying that.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
George bit you?
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
DON'T call the police.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
You should have seen it erect.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
I'm not really hungry after all.
I didn't have to pee then.
You don't have to pee.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Coffee and...
No really, I love knowing what people read.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
No. I was doing my laundry.
A man killed in Central Park.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Peter I love you too but...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
No, take it.
No, I have a cat.
Packages of money.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
And you think I'm sick?
This one walk you home too?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
He tried to kill me!
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
How could you have been so stupid?
Why, yes.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
Not that.  Anything else.
Where does it lead?
Then we must call the police.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
You know something about me?
Water?
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Maybe.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
No, it's the truth.
I'm...  being...  punished.
We are...  living in their dreams...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
They're dead, John.
That's easy.  You...
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this ?
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
Yes.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
I don't think so.
I'm going to kill him.
What I told him to?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Dave -- I'm working.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Really?   Crazy?
What?
Oh.
What?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
The Fidelity nonsense...
You got a gun?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You're kidding.
I'm outta here.
No.
I don't know.
They asked me to help.
I guess.
Yes.
It was inspirational.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Hi.
I know.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
What?
What?
Come on. Let's go.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
They're townies?!
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
But why?
Knox, you gotta calm down.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
So much the better.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
What?
But...
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
what?!
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Sure.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Then come with me.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Again!  Louder!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
You have another choice.
Yes sir.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
My brother went here.
I... I just don't want to come.
What?
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
It's my birthday.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
I don't know.
How do we get out of here?
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
You're going to have to get a new one.
Did you clear this?
Self sufficient...
On the side!!
How do you know that?
And what if I run into one of those things?
No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
You ain't giving the orders here!
Forget them...
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
I have been.
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Joey...
Nothing.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
Yeah, Sal--
It's Nick!
Yeah.
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
It won't open.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Sure. Why not.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Yeah.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Too bad.
Naw.
You know a guy named Merle?
Now he's back.
Oh, well...
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Will you marry me?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
What?
Nick.
There's Vince!
Right.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Yeah... I guess.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
From Nam?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Watch it, shithead!
No.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Yeah.
Where?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Naw.  Uh-huh.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Telephone repairman.
Ooops, I forgot.
Yes.
But Sergeant...
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Thanks.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
You treat her nice.
Hospital food.
You be careful.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
My granddad was a policeman.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No -- that's for me to do.
Jabez! Careful --
Belle --
I didn't.
Guess there will, if it says so.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
And what about Daniel Webster?
Why? It don't hurt.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
No! No! I won't.
Not me! 
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Black Dan'l?
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Well, I'll be -- 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
About what?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Ten throws it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Dan'l Webster?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
That's what we said.
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Let him try it.
Coming, Ma.
I guess we won't.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
You mean -- a jury trial?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
You can talk to me ...
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Who said we were terrorists?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Roy?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Listen.
Come on, what's under this?
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
I love you.
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
What trip?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
What?
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
You think it over, Leon.
Who's this?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Call me whatever you want.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Sonny, come on out!
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
I want to talk to him.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
If you take anybody, please take me.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Yeah.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
No, that's all.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
My body?  What for?
Yes...
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
I want him to think that.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
Alive.
All right ... send them the guard.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I want to talk to Leon.
You follow my car. 
I speak what I feel.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
... Just give me time to think...
Yeah - it looks real official.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Not now, Mom, please.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
You're news, Sonny ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Yes.
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Take us to Vegas.
No. Please enlighten me.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
I can certainly think of one more!
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Many times.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
Have you noticed something about them?
You a troublemaker?
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
How old are you?
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Fifty cents.
I'm going with you.
What are you so worked up about?
Yeah, me too.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Don't worry about it.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
It's dug.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
What?
Talk to your son.
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Shit!  I forgot.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Why you gotta curse?
Lie down, please.
You're still late.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Mookie's OK.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
I know.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
HARRY Dunne.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I'm just not ready.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
Oh, of course.
You brave soldier.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
You take that back!
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Yea!
Hey, where did you come from?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A blimp.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Do you want me to pet your head?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Can you believe it?
Have you got what I want?
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The evidence of what?
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Is he....?
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Pain.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Did they try and fail?
SILENCE!
I'd know the difference.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
It is my home.
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Eddie, you screwed up.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Perfect.
This is the big moment...!
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Oh.  Congratulations.
This is my thirteenth pair.
I am.  How's your father?
Okay?
The sun.
C'mon!  Let's just go.
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
NOOOOO!!!
Anything good?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
I'm moving out.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
What?
Excuse me.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Ed --
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Your brother's here.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Right.
Oh.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Hey, he cheated on her.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
The doctor said you were having sex.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Yeah, well...
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
Oh yeah.
No. Who?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
There's a list.
Ed?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Show business.
You're in show business?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Yeah?!
Marcia's living with a singer?
You brought the cameras here!
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hi.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
What?... Why?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
By the X.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Do it!
What?
So nice
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
I think we've got a problem.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Okay, fine. Sure
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Yeah.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
My house.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
What is it. Tammy?
And how did you get in the school?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I know.
Thought what?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What's it to you?
Till 19-fucking-70.
That obvious, huh?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
We talked.
So tell me about it.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
<u>What do you want</u>?
I got to write my report first.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
She told you?
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Let's just kill them.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Against your code?
I got her address.
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Dogs got no reason to live.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Yes, I do, sir.
Okay.  I'll do it.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
What?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Lynn Bracken.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
You, me and White, huh?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Do you have any proof?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
A bootleg...
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Why?
Wait.
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Move it.
I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
They come after you?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Them.
What about newspapers and magazines?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if--
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
I'm married.
Yes. I have her permission.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
The robbery.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Was he with anyone?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
It's okay.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
Yeah...look--
What happened to your head?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
My suitcase is gone.
I don't believe it is, no.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
When do I get to meet him?
DePinto?
It's how he works.
Why would I--
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I'm gonna fix it.
We believe he did.
--otherwise we may have to--
Merry Christmas, son.
Oh, well, that's true.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Bobby--
Are those my Christmas presents?
Dad!
You staying for dinner?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Alright!
Usually they take clothes.
You're tired.
You gotta--
To the cops?
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yeah.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
And if it wasn't?
Then let's assume I don't.
What kind of fossils?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
You felt obliged to.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
He said - be careful.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, but I think I do.
A surprise, he said.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't leave me!
Very well.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
What?
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Her hands and feet were tied.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
Which we've overflown twice.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
You were in Africa?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Please don't creep around this house.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
The rest meant nothing to me.
No, now I can't kill you.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I'm turning you.
I can see my wife in that view.
He needn't disturb you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I follow the wires.
Kip… I -
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I had a hotel room.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
The windows don't open.
Exactly.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
We're getting close.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
You...you can't.
Well, no...but...
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Possibly.
Look on the back. What do you see?
I'm a thief. Sue me.
What's my problem? You want a list?
And--
In a week.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It was a long time ago.
Charged?
Something like that.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Got it.
It's your mistake.
Get the hell in.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
My job, my rules.
Transfer.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Feeling old?
Have really held you under?
That's because you grew up rich.
They drive so recklessly there.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You damn well thought wrong.
She's calling the shots now.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Thought you had to use some of these.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
Don't use language with me --
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
All of them.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Excuse me?
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
What do you mean?
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Fuck Kurt.
There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
That's right.
You come to the right place.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
It happens all the time.
When?
I'm gonna go live with George.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
I do.
Ten?
Why not?
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm gonna clean it up.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Nothing.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Wow, that's soon --
Yes?
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, My Lord.
We've discussed this before.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
We?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
We've got to get out of this shower.
How do I look?
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
You're going to attack them?!!!
That depends.  Where are we?
A mining colony.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
Well, what now?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Only what you take with you.
It is the future you see.
No!
Never.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Please
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Yes...
You told me he was dead.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Not anymore.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Dream on, blue eye.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's the deal.
Having second thoughts?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Yeah, I got it.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
We'll see.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Who?
Are you crazy?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
...Perceval!
Move aside!
But your life and lands are far from here.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Of Merlin?
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
What is this place, Merlin?
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
And you cannot love me...
Me?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Just show the sword.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Just five or six people.
Didn't who tell me?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
What man?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
That's good.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Are you sure?
About my daughter?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
The priest.
You wouldn't.
Are you sure?
Have you told him what's happening?
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
Father?
No.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
I don't know
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
What?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
I've seen it.
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
Uoy era ohw.
Last month.
But deliver us from the evil one.
In the face of the enemy.
Defender of the human race...
Always.
I've seen him.
From the psychiatric end.
It's possible. Possible however…
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Twelve.
Your pay.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Maybe next time.
How will he eat?
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
My pleasure.
How we doing?
Am I late?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Thanks.
So do I.
Your older brother.
It's me.
What?
No?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
What?
It's early.
She'll get here.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Really.
How long you been at it?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
He was just having fun.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
No.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah?
She asked for it.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
We're a team.  We work together.
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Save it for your wife.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Did you hear it?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Great?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Frank works hard.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Aren't the kids asleep?
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
It's a shitty  song.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Huh?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
I've given it up.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.
Losing his teeth.
What happened to the donut king?
My days are not the old days, genius.
Wow.
Sure.
Fine.  You?
Huh? Oh, no.
You mean if I get sick?
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
My place.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Or reactivated the first one.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
That's what they always say.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
That's your name, isn't it?
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
All I’m saying it there isn’t a guy in Union County who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Me?
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Give me my goddamn life back!
Why not?
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Why not?
Because you’ll be here.
Really.
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
And now...?
It’s like a museum.
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Aspen.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm taking the train...
If it's something you feel strongly about.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Youthful high spirits.
He's made a few changes.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Got it, teach.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'm worried about you.
It's easy for you to be patient.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
No...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
Say that again?
Trip? Where to?
As part of the Crew.
Difficult? He's impossible!
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Thank you for volunteering.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Now I know...
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
I have no idea.
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
Send the following message...
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Two in a row?
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Then don't drift down further.
What do you mean?
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Yah.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Ya kiddin'!
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
...Brainerd?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Okay.
Yah.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
...There's a million dollars here!
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, pretty good.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
No, I didn't...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
What'd he say?
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Uh-huh.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Oh, fine.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
Where's Tyler?
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yeah.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I want that.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
You feel nothing?
No... no problem.
Chloe's dead.
Hear what?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Answer the question!
Say my name.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Tyler?
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yes... it's a test.
Who do you think I am?
Is this part of the test?
No, supply oxygen?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
A hotel?
Can I stay at your place?
What?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
A nice, big cock.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
What car?
Hum.
Okay... Ghandi.
That was three times you promised.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
What should I have told you?
I don't think that's true.
"Applicant?"
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
This isn't possible...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What about Marla?
You... you can't be serious about this.
Defuse the bomb.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Paraffin.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Robert Paulson?
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
So let's do it.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
He probably already knows we're coming.
We need to hurry.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Who?
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Like what?
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Who is this guy, anyway?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
I know how it feels to be dead.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I...I don't know.
I guess so.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
That's a plan.
No. I saw it. I saw it!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
One hundred.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
No.
Damn!  Leeches.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Pirates?  No kidding?
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
I suppose you have...
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Why's that?
I do?
I know.  I go with you.
That's an order.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
It's not necessary.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
You got it, sir.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Yeah!
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
No, I'm fine... really...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
Tragedy?
He's not here.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
My name is Parry.
They're --  -- What?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
They work for Him.
I know...
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
You advise us!
Yeah.
You're married.
No, I...
Shhh...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
Yes.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I love it.
Just finish eating.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
I know.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Bye, Robert.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Tomorrow, then.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
You don't call that music, though.
Thank you.
Then I must have been supplying it.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Yes.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What?! I can't hear you!
Not at all.
I don't think that's true.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Steam.
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Fine.
Not now, I'm busy
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Wussup.
You know somebody around here?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I can't!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
My friend told me she lived around here.
I'm a good friend of hers.
What?
Nothing.
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
Would you like me to change anything?
Wonder who his supplier is.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Margaret.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
No idea.
Like when?
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don’t you?
My pleasure.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
What?
Gum thought Brazil.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
That's it?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
Of course they are.
Right.
What are you doing here?
They busted me last week.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Why not?
Come inside.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I have the same problem with my help.
In this drawer....
Take it where?
They serve dinner on the flight?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Cute thing.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Please.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
See what I mean?
Hi.
Yes.
God...
What about his parents?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I'll take you to a game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Very good, sir.
Muchas gracias.
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
She moved out?
She moved out.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Who?
Not really?
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Who?
But I am...
Thanks, I needed that.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Great pipes.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Fine!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Are you okay?
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Boca?
No... yeah...
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Goodbye.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
It's yours too!
Encore du sho ping!
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
What happens to the schedule?
Who financed it?
What?
No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
Where from?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

Yeah, I know.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Who's on him?
Not a chance.
Suspicion of what?
Pour it in your ear.
What is that old building?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I'm serious.
The future guy?
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I don't know.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
But you're not...you're not still here.
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
She just died, your mother just died?
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What are you talking about?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Whatta we do now?
How?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Hang on.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Dad, you there?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
What's wrong?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
You work too hard, John.
She's pretty special.
Where are you going?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
You go ahead...
A hammock?
And, what about us?
You're Shelly?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Don't say any more.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Did you hear me?!
We'll scare 'em right back.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Please don't do anything crazy.
Look --
I know everything about you, Diana.
Get up!
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Sorry.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Okay.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
You're joking, right?
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
I packed it. Just for us.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Am I? Let's find out.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Yes...
The window...
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Quietly effective.
She wants a divorce.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
What was it like?
Had to be him.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
It can't be all that personal.
We're able to surprise each other.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I'm not sure.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Yes.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
How prominent?
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Where the hell are you?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Where's your elastic brace?
I know, Pop.
How come you got the kid with you?
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Because life is good.
This could be it!
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
How come?
Why?
Yes.
Oh. You know him.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I hear good things about the new play.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
I don't know.
Never mind.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
I don't want you, Steven.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Even as a boy I thought so.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
That's when you take advantage.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Thank you. No.
Somehow I expected not.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Now is your chance to find out.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll see what I can do.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
You have more in common than you know.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
A day or so.
I'm sure I could have.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Friend?
Where?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
We could go together one day.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Antonio--
That's right.
No way. I always do my own work.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
No way. I've got to get out now.
You okay?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Sure...
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Good.
Boring.
Sure.
Really.
Suit yourself.
Bullshit.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Fifteen minutes.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
When they find it, they find it.
When are you going to learn?
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Just get your clothes on...
I guess we are.
We walk.
No, I'm afraid not.
All right. Shells?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Can he trust you?
I know. I know.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
When did you find out?
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
It's the truth.
Really?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Tell me about the girl.
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Thanks.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
They came back?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Yes, thank you.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Still got your sense of humour.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Three hundred altogether?
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
They killed the goose.
You get a bad month, all of a...
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
Yes.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What act?
That's the truth...
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
No.  Not actually.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
What?  What?  The leads.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
What does that mean?
What if you don't get caught?
Why would they come to me?
Why?
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
Where were you?
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse us please?
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Moss...Who told him?
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
The people downtown said...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Moss.
Not lately it isn't.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
I will close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I'm not sure I have two.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Why I don't...
How do you know I made it up?
What are you talking about?
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
I...
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
And did they steal the contracts...?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Yeah.
Yes.
To change our minds.
I don't know.
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
And the check is...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
They took 'em...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
If you don't want it, give it back.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Did you like your party?
They were friends.
Some day you will.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
He's the head of the family.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
The child cannot harm you.
Let's go.
C'mon, I see what I can do.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
What do you want me to do?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
I've always taken care of you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Beautiful.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Kay... Kay...
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I asked about Fredo?
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
I don't know.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
The baby I lost...
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
How is his health?
After dinner.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
It's important.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You want a war?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Splendid.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Really?
What did she mean by going flooey?
Broke is more like it.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
No.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Better work.
Something happened to him?
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'm very sorry.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You didn't, Jimmy.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Yes?
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto.  Let me see.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
One more night --
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
What for?
Let them go --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Something like that -
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
What do you want from me?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Good.
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
That's a good one, Donny...
I think so too --
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
oh.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yeah... You want a ride...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Okay --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Call 'em here -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of me.
I understand -
Very good...
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God...
I do ... I cut "em...
He's gotten involved --
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Why would I get into that?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It'll be okay.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
I better call again.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
But, Paulie, please.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
What are we gonna do up there?
No one. I didn't have the number.
I don't know.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
I wanted to meet your brothers...
I told you, I just got change.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
History.
How'd you like that course?
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Really?
Okay. How?
Half-red, half-black--
I'm pretty sure it's right.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Hey, how you doin'?
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
I appreciate that.
Yes.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I've been busy.
I got your card.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Can we do it at my office?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Now wait a minute--
--Gerry--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
--I'm not angry at you--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
You think so?
Oh.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
How'd it go?
Hence, the word remarried.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
That's right.
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
Do you have a soul-mate?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
The wrench, why?
I know.
I know.
What?
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
No.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
How many?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
We'll do that.
If you bring the caramels.
Then let's go have some fun.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Come with me to California.
I know. I just do.
Why not?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
No, you don't want to hear that.
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
Lots must a died, too.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
I didn't see nothin'.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Say, who runs this place?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Have a little snort?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Been out travelin' around?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
No. They wasn't people to write.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Sure do.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Can't you see that sticker?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.
This here's a strike.
Yes, ma'am.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
But will it--hurt the baby?
I like the tent better.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
He was a good man.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Man bones?
Won't they ketch us?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
What's this?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
It's what I do.
I'm Martin Blank.
What?
What?
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
Yes.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
As long as I get the laugh.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
What?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Up on the right.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Thank you, no.
Okay.
In Portugal, yes.
I love. I kill.
This?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
It's a place where religious people--
Yeah. I guess we did.
Paul?
Thank you.
I'm a professional killer.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Oh yes. I forgot.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Why?
Okay.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I didn't know I had to.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
I think they call it a pasture.
Well, one was for salad...
Thanks, honey.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
So do you.
I should be in by two.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I'm not pretending anything!
She will if you think she should.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
No. He had the choice.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Of course not.
You!
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
She's an editor.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
I don't know if I can.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Super hero like even.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
...as they snoop onto us.
Cereal.
Dead?
Revenge.
And unpack.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
That's bullshit.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
It nibbles. You see this?
We did it!
I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Okay. I'll copy it.
I'll hack the Gibson.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Thanks for your help.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Uhhhmm...
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Gill.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
What, it left a note?
What?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
I'll take you down there.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Who's that?
Not without Jamie.
She's not dead!
Brady!
Can't you find somebody else?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
I can see this is useless.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You won't come on too strong.
Where are you going?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Do you?
Go get it.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
He's here, Sheriff.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Least I'm not alone.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Evil.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Okay.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
That's not true. Here I am.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Probably Mister Riddle.
That's probably all he can do.
Annie!
I can't.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Go get me a beer.
YEAH?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
It's important.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Is Annie around?
Just watch.
What about the bogyman?
Right.
Tommy, let me in!
How?
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Yeah.
It's really terrible.
Okay.
And maybe my lawyer.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Fast.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
...with the affiliates.
Oh, great.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes, I do.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I know.
That's where your talent lies.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Are you angry with me?
No!
I didn't say that.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
You're not lost.
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Hmm?
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
I'm sorry.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Two thousand dollars.
Yeah.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Easily.
Look, everything's going your way.
You got it.
Hmm!
Well--
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
No!
My--uh...
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
I recall you.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Really?
Oh, yeah?  What?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Hi.  How you doin'?
I'm pregnant.
Where are the antihistamines?
...which I did not get.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
A reward...
I hereby acknowledge that...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a growth business.
...very good.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
That's what <u>you</u> think...
And who is "they?"
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Show me the Pigs.
I like Popcorn...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I think its meaning is clear.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You nervous...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Said what?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I have had the honor. 
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
I require...
We got KittyKat...
Is it necessary to know?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I realize, you're under a lot of....
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...might I make a suggestion...?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
...not to turn around.
I don't understand.
...what do you expect me to...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
The shape of a Three.
Thank you.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
...would you use a small word?
Yes.
That's right.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Wha-at?  What is it?
What are you gonna do about it?
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
Your Secret admirer?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Talia, you're a wonderful person...

You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Talking while kissing.
Iunno.
Don't get cocky, girl.
You're beautiful.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
You're not funny. Ouch!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Jealous much?
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Suicide is a private thing.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Good plan.
Like a suicide thing?
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
French.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Of course.
Did to.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Goddamn Geek!
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Sure. Ciao.
What's that?
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
breaks down into heavy sobs.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Love, you can still write to each other.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
He . . .
That . . .
You're such an incredible woman.
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Yes . . .
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
The way you just looked at me...
Bull...
Eighty third most common.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Since what?
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Getting paid for doing shit.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Yeah? You and who else?
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
It's perfect.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Who the hell are you talking to?
Two.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Me!
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Goodnight, John.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
That too.
Said he's not an actor.
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
They're really white.
Let's watch some TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Well, it's for a woman.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
-- a sense of proportion.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Yeah, that was easy.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Have you just plain asked him?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
And it's a shorter commute.
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
He made, you know, a remark.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Philip!  The senior partner?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
Grow up, Dreyer.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What about cable?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
A few days ago.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
You?
If it came down to it what would you do?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What worries you?
You always get to go first.
The past?
Why not?
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
I don't know anymore.
Why?
Why not?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
What?  How?
We'll see.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
That's what the Kurgan said.
How can that be?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I'll make the call.
It's happening right now.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I'm here.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I gotta piss real bad.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Use more ice.
You can't run with suitcases.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I know.
He said something about a girl --
Keep your head down.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Maddox!  You got that?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
It's right in front of us.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Your phony FBI assholes.
We are looking for you.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
There is nothing to it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Six.
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Yes we have.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
Today.
Listen, you need me.
You have no whiskey?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will give you my house.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Homework?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
They know you are Tutsi!
Where are you hurt, son?
Get in.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What for Paul.
A car.
What sort of car?
I want to know.
No.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Three times, to be exact.
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
Best of a nightmare.
I'm better than that.
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
There's always exceptions.
-- that's the fact, bud --
What about that other guy?
Jesus!
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
-- in the act.
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
What're you talking about?
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Please! I need your help.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
It works.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
I can't comment until I get paid.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You say you saw some activity here?
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By freeing them.
Maybe it was Colleen...
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
I'm ok mommy.
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
For good luck honey.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Oh come on...
What?
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Should I...
We're not going.
What's happening!
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Oh, that's nice...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
And what would you do?
Runic?
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
That is the story of my life.
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Gum.
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
God go with you, sister.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Trust Leonardo....
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
What job?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
Too bad.
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Snappy.
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Yeah.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
You mean you know about this?
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Phony, huh?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Says who?!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
I got big ideas, though!
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?! But, buddy --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
-- tough titty toenails!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Not even behind your back?
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
He don't look wise.
She's damn good, Lou.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Thank you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Yes -- on the boat.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Of course, Wes.
You can't really believe that.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
I am not a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Why did you come in here?
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
I... I think I am...
What?
Stuffed and baking.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
No advice from the experts, huh?
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
You're not going to --
Elena.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Hnnn.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
What you been up to?
Jesus all right enough!
What do you think we're doing, dad?
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
A key party?
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Hi Wendy.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
I gotta get to English class.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
You going to tell dad?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
How do you know this shit?
Tell Sandy? What?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
You like him? He worships you.
Yeah. Yours?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Her name's Libbets.
One more shot?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
I had him!
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
We already did.
Twelve years younger.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
That must have been awful for you.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
He would have liked that.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
You know my plan of action.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Don't do this, Hap...
I'm always all business.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
I told you I don't remember.
Best friend?
That's a long time.
Long as it's fun.
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
But we work so well together...
Then so was mine...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Are you the leader of tis group?
What are we?
You mean we are not children of Satan?
If you say so. You are innocent.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
We can do that?
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You let them do it.
And yet you knew what I would o.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
I didn't realise.
What plans?
No. Laudanum.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Yes, and very beautiful.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
How do you mean, start?
Sure...
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
It can't be...
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I don't know any hell -
What do you imagine you are Louis?
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Yes!
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
What the hell would you call this?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
No, I'm the King of the World.
I also promised Tyrell.
Some.
Just kidding.
They never found the body.
It's too late for that.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
I told you.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
What do you mean, Julie?
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, I'm in school and --
No. Yes?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Good winds and bad winds!
This was once a cemetery.
No one can take my father's place.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
My last name is Pherides.
But one must love a father.
She is dead — at peace.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Her name is Thea?
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Don't . . . George?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
Where's Mary?
I'm not supposed to tell.
George Bailey.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hiya, George!
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
No.
Yes, sir.
Aw, forget it.
Hope you enjoy it.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Hello, Violet.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
I know, but . . .
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Five hundred dollars.
I'll take chocolate.
Okay –– what can we lose?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
I'm going to scream!
About what?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
To keep from being an old maid.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
George, darling! Where have you been?
I don't care. It's George's tux.
What?
Stop paddling!
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
You're betting what you already got.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Every day?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Do I have to?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Hey, come on....
What?
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Can't you tell?
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Right.
It's good with coffee.
In the den.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
I know you did....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did you say Cable Junction?
Dad!  Dad!
Now I really want to see it.
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Nope.
Just like this.
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything.  Anything.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
Oh, great.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Not tonight.
How was dive class?
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
Forget it, he won't listen.
Don't forget you have your brother.
My imagination isn't that good.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
It's his work.
Get out of here!
I don't have a choice.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
That we swim.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Yes.
After what happened to us?
Here.
Yes.  It's faster.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
... Okay.
Nobody told me.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
I thought they were clever.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Afraid I can't do that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Brian, he's coming around!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
'Preciate it.
Someone's looking for you.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
Come on!  Check this out!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Polar bears.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
It's large enough...
Got a job for me?
Sharks???
That's Dad...
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Nowhere....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
You caught me....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
You can stay in my room.
Good night, Daddy....
You guys must be starving....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I'm not going to quit now....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm fine....
There's nothing to worry about....
Promise me....
You must get bored easily.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Good.  I have two left....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
The whole idea is preposterous....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
Inch by inch....
Oh, boy....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
She's not going to like it....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Good night, Polly....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
O.K.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
Listen to me saying what?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Wrong cabinet.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No.
No.
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
I know.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I'm blind because my father drank.
What does that mean?
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I know about the bachelor party.
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
I have to finish my job --
It's over --
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Same to you.
-- especially one like this.
Plus, you could use that commission.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
Tell me -- let me help --
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
What about Ray?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
I'm sorry, I --
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Yes.
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
I might call you later!
Uh, not today, but --
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Great word.  Towel?
How do I know?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Well.  Good luck with that --
Damn right.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
You wanted smaller.
-- and I'll get 'em.
They do, my brother.
Hi Ray.
One way to find out.
What's a bad idea?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
I filmed this the morning they left.
No, it's...
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
You think they could talk to each other?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Any weapons, radios?
Yeah.
What did you think?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
No.  I feel something.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
What are you talking about?
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
On the side of that one truck.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
How close do you have to be?
You've broken its leg!
Piss.
Why?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Look!  Sarah!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
What?
I believe in him.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Why?
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Dilophosaurus.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - barfs them up - -
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
You can't hold it by yourself!
I don't know.
It's anti-nature.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Tim, are you okay?
Yes it is.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
You got me.
Nope.
Why?
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
For a further three years.
Who?
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
We love the presents.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
You want to put in chain saws?
I think we're lost.
Who's there?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
So?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
I read the one about the penal colony.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I'll commit that to memory.
You're detestable.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
He was murdered.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I -- I found your jailer.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't know.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
-- You mean my Chief has it.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
No! Don't!
Jack!...  Jack!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Oh my God ... Ann?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Mm.
I'd just be guessing.
Guess!
Yes indeed.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
A few more days. We know who did this.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Mm.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
What do you think?
Is that what you gave him?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Mm.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Thanks.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
But if it's someone else I do.
We did this before.
Bree --
Go down in my room.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
You're going back?
About what?
Then, close the case.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What's in it?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No.
No.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Yes sir, we know he --
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
Goodbye.
Sorry.
Uh huh...
Yep.
Sure.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Sustained.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
I do not, your honor, however--
No, I did not.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes.  Very much.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Yes...
And how did you find his work?
Do you have a lover now?
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
How long was that?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You have?
You've been living here, in the city?
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What if I fight it?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
I told her you're doing a
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Please, Thel...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
Yes, but they say he did.
I miss my brother.
No. This war is almost over.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
America, we shall see.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Thank you.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
True.
Is that true or pretend?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Ahh.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
Am I running away?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
You have grown up very good.
Completely.
Thank you.
I need to see his habitat.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Cocktail?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I don't know!
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
We're ready.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
So I don't like tents, why--
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
You flew up here because your boss--
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Really--
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
You wouldn't?
Likewise.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Was he swallowed?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
You think Jack's handsome?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
He said he knew Karate!
It's ten after nine.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Kevin told me you were upset.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why not?
Well, except for the one girl.
I don't know! Get me out!!
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I understand.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
I think so.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
I have no doubt of it.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
They all were.
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
No! That's incidental.
No. We just -
What was it?
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
Did you breast-feed her?
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
We leave in the morning?!
Yes, miss.
Let us go, miss.
Your "father"?
And by sea!
Some say that's the way of it.
Yes. Yes, I will.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
You're not coming with us?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Yes, sir.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Atten-hut!
Gifts?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
And this?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Granted.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
France.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Can you fix it?
Just get in yours!
Still...you did the right thing.
Has it helped?
He's not at his station.
Roger.
Okay.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Well what?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
It's a Samoan pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Where did he get a hundred grand?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
All right, Dad.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
There is only three of us here.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I will loan you the money.
And that does include the amp?
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Leave your sister out of it.
So?
They're not going to jail.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You look good--
Best part of the job.
No. You?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Uncle Al--
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
That guy who got shot--
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
He's still pissed off about it.
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Tanks, huh?
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Yeah?
Seriously.
We been through this before--
You know who it was they dug up?
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
That ring--
Take that pair over in the corner--
Yeah. I bet he would.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Because I'm your father.
Bandidos, Injuns--
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Aqui! [Here!]
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Right.
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
If you spent a little more time training them--
A little older than Paloma is now.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
You had to deal with him in running the club.
And my father?
People didn't complain?
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
I'll see what's going on.
He hates me.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
The shooter local?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
I been working on a few things.
The Republicans?
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
You going to tell him?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Death.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
That's my business. Harry.
Stuff?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
It's okay.
Yes.
I think so.
You saw this?
No word from D'Amour?
He got up and walked.
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
No.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Shit...
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And you're not?
And he didn't have them?
Yes.
One question.
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
Binding you.
Yes.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
You'll do it?
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Oh.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
That's too scary.
Because that would be too easy.
We should get you to the doctor.
I'm going to miss you.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Hi, Lydia.
It's just carpet.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
What?
Hello?
What?
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
One moment.
What?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
What?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's ok if you are.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Thank God he did.
I believe in you.
This is the person...you were talking about?
Must be a spare set.
Peter, are you okay?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
I think I should join you.
You heard voices, you know you did.
He will.  He has great faith.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Something he said, just before...
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
So what?
What's the...OH SHIT!
What do you mean?
Whish the circumstances were different.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Parents died?
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
You're cold?
Careful.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Why not?
Mom's going to hate it.
No one's forcing her.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
What?
So how's the job going?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
God, here we go.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
With a jacked-up attitude.
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
You do see me standing here, right?
I said fine.
Quit.
Clothes.
What?
She understands.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Here I am.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
We're going to get some food.
Least she had time for me.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
I never asked you to choose.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I don't think so.
Thanks.
Oh yeah?
No.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Wow.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Cause I don't get it.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
Hey.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Oh, she's fine.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
You won't.  You won't have to.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Well...is that illegal?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Really?
So you've done it --
Why not?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
What?
Say what you want and you'll see --
-- what kind?
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Ok.
I don't know.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
I was listening --
What happend?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
This sounds threatening.
What?  What does that mean?
Might of been before my time.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Brad, dear?
-- Samuel Johnson.
Picky, picky.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
Don't do this, Don.
Yeah.
...ah...
Get a girlfriend.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
You got it.
Graduation?
I think you have the wrong number.
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
So boring, so useless --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
Around here.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Is he in pain?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
It's interesting.
...ok...
yeah.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
I don't have to answer your questions.
Ok. What's your name?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Yes.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm drinking.
Rose, I don't --
No.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Do you know the answer to this?
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
You're her boyfriend?
Like what?
No they don't --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
I have to go.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
Should be one-thirty.
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Why did you do this?
Go to bed.
I hate it.
I have money.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
No, M'lady.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
May I speak with you?  Alone?
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
No, Louis!  No!
Replace the king.
A body.
Three days??!!
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
I know.  God go with you.
That doesn't matter now.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
I heard your playing.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Porthos told me.
Whose rooms are those?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
No, Keeper.
Eh?
... Two-thirty-seven.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Sire, I --
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Alright, stay on the phone.
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Right behind you.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Gotta come from somewhere...
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
No.  A witness.
What did you do then?
No...I'm in some trouble...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I'm not going anywhere!
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Did you have sex with her?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Twenty minutes max.
When do they go to press?
Book code?
Not the Bible?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Where?
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
The mark? Yes.
Get me a plane...
Get me a plane!
When are you coming back?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
See if there's another label underneath.
Let's get to the physical.
When do you need it?
It'll do fine.
In the kitchen.
Uh-huh.
It's a surprise.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I'll get my purse.
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis...?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
That's true.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
I remember.
Do you remember what you said?
No.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Will? Are you okay?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
Yeah...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
No.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Why should I tell you?
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
Let's walk the route.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
I don't wanna talk about it!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
So?  What do they know?
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
It's working for Elvis.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
What's your name?
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
The orders were for your protection.
Two grand.
I don't know... My computer...
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
He's going to pop!
Sorry.
I got you.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
It's an honor.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Wild, isn't it?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
What -- what lesson?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
And she's never wrong.
What do you believe in?
Yes I do.
You're the Oracle?
Not too bright though.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Of what?
From what?
Is it?
Should I be?
Yes.
I'm going in after him.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
What the hell just happened?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Look fella...this is private...
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
How do you know?
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I could have told you that.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Don't be smart.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Get him in.
Let's go to the movies...on you.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Whatever.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Well...
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Yeah, so things'll be even.
Friends of yours Michael.
Quiet please.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
He's cute.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
And you could care less --
We've got some things to discuss.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Oh, the goddam party --
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Yes, it is.
He said he would be there with bells on.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Honey --!
9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Right away.
Drew, you're out of line.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
He'll wait --
Here...
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Sit down, Drew.
For how long?  And why?
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
He was interested.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Make it go 'way.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Sure.
Jennifer.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Oh yes, I do.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
I am Joe.
That is not my intention.
Watch me do what?
Yes...I've found that it does.
'To bed'?
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
More than you love peanut butter?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
I love you in an evening gown.
And you can't tell me who you are.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Sounds fair enough.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Can you keep a secret?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't know.
About Susan?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I told you, 'watch it'.
No.
I don't expect you to.
-- An IRS man.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
'...Yes --'
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
It's enough now.
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Good morning, Quince.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Thank you, Quince.
Yeah.  Or the week after.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Yes, I believe I do.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
You don't know anything about Joe --
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
But we've got time.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Couple days.
Hi, Leonard.
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You did explain, Lenny.
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What happened?
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
No!
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's different.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
About your whore of a wife?
Why not?
Oh. But haven't we met before?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Thank you.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Why?
Why?
Fucking hope not.
Give me your keys.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
And...?
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Tell them what you want.
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
How many?
The Keys?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
That's right.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Really?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
No.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
What kind of weight?
Where?
We're makin' moves on each other.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Where's Riccardo?
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
...and thanks for the flowers.
What's it say?
What would you do...?
Define small.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You sure you heard what I said?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
You inviting shee-it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
What you got me up here for?
You got it.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
How much?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
...She was on the plane.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
What do you mean?
Get the... midnight... express.
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
What?
After we're outside the kogus?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Oh shit.
No!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
You're ayip!
That's a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Who?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
The kid's with them!!
What do you-?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Nino, please...
Across both tracks!!
Manny...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
I'll be late.
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Just do it!!
Peter-
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
She used a baster.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I guess that means it's okay.
Done?
Yes.
I don't know.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
I want my pills NOW!
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
You've been out of your room.
I'm glad you like it.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm sure you're right.
You're still a writer.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
All done, chief..
Not possible..
Well that depends.
On what.
How do you that.
Ahh..
Then don't say it.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Not for seven more minutes.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Far right.
Indeed.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Listen to what?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Something like that.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
How do you suggest I go about it?
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.
You gotta be kidding.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Yep.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
By asking me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
What about him...?
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
You don't think we're going to make it.
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
Bastard!
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Why don't you come back with me?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
I didn't touch it.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Very well.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Can you lose him?
- and picked us up in the States -
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I want you to stop seeing her.
No. You were there.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Ti amo.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He did?
What'd you do to your hair?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
Why?
I'm going to marry him.
I have no life.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
I'm making you a steak.
I don't know.
Why you talking to me?
I'm telling you your life!
A bride without a head!
A wolf without a foot!
What?
I'm marrying your brother!
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Kinda gaudy.
It's the best thing there is.
How can you ask me that?
He didn't come!
I'm afraid of who I am.
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Will you marry me?
I don't understand.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Alright. A month. In a month.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Where's the ring?
No.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
He should pay.
I don't know.
Yes.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
But absolutely!
Definitely!
Sure!
Will you join me for dinner?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
It's Cosmo's moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
You're using coconuts!
...What?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
NI!   NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
What is that?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
Course I have.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
My liege,  I am honored.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
There are some who call me Tim?
A G...g...g...
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
What?
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Yes, Lord.
And therefore?
To find the Holy Grail.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
To seek the Grail!
Yes he is.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
When's your next round?
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
We'll cover your escape!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
We must examine you.
Please ... we are doctors.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
I didn't.
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
She'll be worried about me.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
I see.
I'm flattered you think so.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
The future King!
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
Back and upper corridors.
Aye, do.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
It can wait.  Anything else?
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I wouldn't know.
Maybe, once.
Yes.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I do not accept.
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
So?
Who?
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Yes.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
The same, your Majesty.
A few days, ma'am.
And now I am back.
Read it!
Your Majesty --
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you stop The Screamer?
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
You imagined it.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Like the fractals?
What are you going to do?
Yeah.  The Inferno.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Got it.
I know.
And then keep on driving?
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
The Cowboy??
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
One.
Okay.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Are you okay?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
No. I can't.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
What do you mean?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
We'll take our check.
I'm all right.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Do you know them?!
But I want to.
Yes, Sir.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
Where's the dock ?
No !
I'm not fucking him..
We have to climb up that.
So what do we do ?
What ?
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Let's go.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Girder, watch your head.
I work here, remember ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Look...
That's cute asshole.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Don't eat at the console.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Yes, sir Mom. 
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Better, sir.
Sir ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I was.
Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Zach from work ?
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
This is California, anything is possible.
Don't mention it.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
No.
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
What if you don't wanna be found?
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Just give it to me!!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Leave me alone!!
And you'd be my cousin?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
This has been a real confusing day.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Was Rose.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
You want me to come with?
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
He was caressing.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Is that a yes?
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
I'll be here.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Is there milk in them already?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Good for you baby.
All right, here.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Keep your voice down!
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
It's nice.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Good.
Is it really your camper?
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Dad??
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Why?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh come on.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Bye.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Oh yes, yes.
My Dad was funny?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Come on sweetie.
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
They're just fun to read.
If I do it, can we go?
Hey, where does it say that?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
What?
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Sure.
He likes her better than me.
Okay, seeya.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
But then I won't be able to see anything.
What?
Part of being a New Yorker.
... weeks.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Let's not get carried away.
That was Thursday.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Needing.
To belong to someone.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
You win.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly what?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
It doesn't say th...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
I never eat when I'm serene.
The night we met.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Well.  How come she didn't...
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
... and you knew about this.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
You'll have to speak up.
Bye, Bye.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
They can come to the concert in the park.
That's what he wants.
President.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
How'd you get in here.
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
I'm not really a musician.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
Get in.
Oh... Well.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
Older.
That's what you said before.
What?
Fifteen minutes?
What...?  0h, yes.
I see.
What?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
For him?
Where are you going?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Just a minute.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Where is she?
Southern California.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
You think I should take lessons?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
May I see your costume?
That's what Tim said.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Who is we?
I can appreciate that.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
I'm keen with anticipation.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory.
On average forty million.
Yes.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Just for fun, I guess.
Take a wild stab!
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Rockin'!
Slate it.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Come on, honey.
It sure is.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
I'll smile when it's funny.
She done moved to Detroit.
Okay.
Guess so.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Your folks live there?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
You still didn't answer my question.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Like what?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Who're you?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
'Don't sound so sure.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Just tryin' to be helpful.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Okay.
Guess it's never been easy.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
I know.
Hi.
No. Why?
Right here.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
Did you trace it?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
The access code to your mainframe.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Yeah. That was me.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How's the ice break?
How long, Dixie?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
What?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Almost two days.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Something exotic I hope.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
...And if I guess wrong?
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Oh I know.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Right. 7:30.
Oh. I forgot.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Anita!
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!

You need my help?
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
You crossed over.
By Guy?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
No. Josie, this is real.
And a gymnast!
Thanks. And what are -
I-
Sure, why?
Don't look down!
I don't have to say that.
Why do you do that?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
Don't be a smart ass.
No.  Upstairs.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Ken!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
He's dead, you bitch.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
What are you doing here?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
I know.
Yeah?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What's this?
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
There's nothing to figure out.
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Eggs?
Okay, I guess.
All of them.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
He's full of shit.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
They're healing up nicely.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Deal.  Thanks.
To old friends.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
He's heavy in the halls...
I think so.
So?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
It's been a long time.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
For what?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
This is stupid.
I'm a vegetarian.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
And then I... right.
Really?
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Okay.
I was.
What did you say?
I don't know either.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Well...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Well... how have you been?
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Does the girl have a name?
Yes.
The movie star?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Di Caprio.
It was good.
Blimey.  What's that?
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
So it could have been neither of them?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No -- did you?
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
So not over her, in fact.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
No -- you're right.
Just take my work for it.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Oh sure.  Of course.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Yes, ma'am.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
What for?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Right!
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Go ahead! Go back!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Marry who?
M-M-M-Mack?
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
No.
Ca-na-da...
What? Where?
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Sure, Mack...
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
Lemme see...
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Lobotomy?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Let me see your hand!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
I'm hungry.
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
We'll let you know.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
Oh, yeah...
P.A. What the hell is that?
This way, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sure you will.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
What?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
Your hair... is perfect.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
No...
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Sa dov'e' lui?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
No.
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hm.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
My name's 
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
I'm in love with you.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
You are leaving, aren't you?
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Nice dress.
No.  Course not.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Beautiful place...
Yes?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Oh.
But somebody wrote those songs.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Sure you did.
Oh my God.  Where?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
Who said I was going?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
You said it differently then.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
But my own kid bro—
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I know. I know.
See! You don't understand!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
They play pretty rough.
Man, you were a mess!
What?
I really don't know.
Good. So do I.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Our Lord said just the opposite.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
But that's living like an animal—
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
I know... I know... .
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
Get away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
My pigeons... .
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I don't want to hear it in there.
I don't get it!
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
D 'n D?
What?
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'—
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
I think you could have.
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah?
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Okay.
Where?
In there.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You love me then?
Ahh, she will be yours.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
You better hope there is.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
What do you suppose for?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
He didn't want me to.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
He knows where she lives?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, I did.
Whatta you wanna do?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Sure, Daniel.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
If I could have a little more room.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
Is that how you think of yourself?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I told you, I'm not going back.
Oh, nuthin'.
In the trunk?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Of course not.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
What's to think about?
Five point two.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
Meaning?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Gimme another hint.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Why would I do that?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Here?  In this house?
Something better.  Open it.
Can we change the subject?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I see that.
Hello?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
None I'd like to share.
I told you, he isn't here.
I don't have any idea.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
That's me, Sir.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Hale-what?
What the hell happened to you guys?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
Come on!
Home of the brave.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Brilliant, Admiral.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
All of 'em.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Peggy Sue!
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Don't say that...
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
He's trying.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Coffee and a donut.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I can't do that.
I hate chickens.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
I'm home now.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
What do you mean?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
You look pretty good for a corpse.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
What are you doing?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Did you break up with Charlie?
How'd you know that?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Zowie.
He was dead. You know he was.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
In a word, Bob...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with your face?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
You're not smiling.
One hour!
Drew!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Of course.
About my blood work?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Congratulations.
Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
What?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Arline?
It's me, you dork.
Get it?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Yes.
Thank you.
Something like that.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
No.
Answer the question, please.
Thank you.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Where's Dad?
Objection.
Were you recently promoted?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
What did you say?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
That's correct.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
In a word, yes.
Great.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Okay, Joe...
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Any women on board?
Yes, we did.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Andy, you don't want this.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
Lookit. Lookit!
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
But I just wanted to say --
Let's drop back an' boot up.
But they...they could still be....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
There is no "safe."
Which half?
You mean....
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
I'm born-again.
Not staying in here another....
Oh, so I'm disposable?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
I apologize.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Remembers what?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
I'll see.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Don't bother
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Okay.Up to the cave.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
Yes.
Taylor, please --
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
We can't.
Where?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah, what is it?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
I volunteered.
Later...
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Fuck you Elias.
What are you talking about! 
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
I really don't know.
Would you mind?
Why certainly, baby.
Immigration Officer?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
How did you meet him?
There wasn't any plane.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Just who are you, anyway?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Couldn't be.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Would I want to?
Right, Miss.
It is?
Yes.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
To do what?
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
We know everything.
Who's Goble?
This way.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
For five hundred, what do I get?
Why not here?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Martini.
And without much discrimination.
I've got good ears.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Could we discuss that some other time?
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Recently, then.
Floater?
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You get it's brother.
When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
Where's the shell?
Such as?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh nothing.
Warm water, no doubt.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I don't understand.
That leaves two strangers.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Not too far, I hope.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I have a rough idea.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
Yes.
It's fine, thank you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Yes.
Sit on that log, dear.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Are you going to have coffee?
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Well, you should.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
It's shit.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
The torture of small children--
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Hello.
Oh, I see.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Yes, you said.
Well, it's worth seeing.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Darling Susan.
I won't.  Goodnight.
And that's why you never went pro?
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Got it.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Figured you did.
I'm serious.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
What do you mean?
Like the old days, Dillon.
Go on.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
They're getting better equipped every day.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
No more games.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
You know you can't win this one.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
The best friend I ever had.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
He's not really my uncle.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Who indeed...
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
It pays.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Occupational hazard?
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
No?  Why's that?
What?
Done.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
I got a dress, yeah.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I think you'll approve.
You're forgiven.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
The opera.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
Did you?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
The young lady staying in your room?
Afternoon.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Doing what?
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
He's not gonna want us.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
I leave extras, miss.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
It's very expensive.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Then I'm here till I die?
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
I do not marry tonight.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
You mock my pain!
But how can you be sure?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
It's you.
True!
Yeah?
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
What?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Okay.
As you wish...
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
And what is that?
I ought to be after twenty years.
You've made your decision then7
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
What?
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
"Of the silvery moon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Well, sir, it seems ...
Where?  What?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Two pistachios, my good man.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
What is it?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vat about it?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
The Blue Max...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Very early. Dawn.
No.
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
And when she left, she never came back.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.
Must've needed it.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Sam, if she's here...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
What?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
I don't know.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
A good reason, I suppose.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Contemplate your... panic button.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
In a hurry.
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Neither will I.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
I could stand something regular.
Sam!
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I imagine so.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Why don't you go away?
You slept here all night?
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Is there?
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize...
Why?
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
I didn't think so.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Did I?
Did she talk?
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
You--a friend to me?
Maybe you're right.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Go to sleep!
That called ... commanded ...
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Did you? Where?
I don't agree with you.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
What do you think I am?
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
You mean he was colored?
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Nope, I'm through!
Get out of here.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
No kiddin'?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
That's what I said.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
You did miss --
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Where is she?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Well, nothin'.
You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Good night, Rose.
But I don't know who they are.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
I do, too.
I do, too!
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
What did you say, Brother?
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Let's go peep from the living room.
What are they doing, Doll?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Of course.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
All right, darlin'.
You're not having lunch?
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Yes, sir.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
You don't know where you're going?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, sir.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Yes, ma'am.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Get ready.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
They shot us all, kid.
Feeling great.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Bullshit.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Can't you say something nice once?
You going rogue on me?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
You can't be serious.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
It's our job.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Let's hope.
Out here.  On your knees.
Just got here.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Who is that... ?
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
Yoda will always be with you.
I can't kill my own father.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
I can't see.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
His lightsaber.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Leia!
I'm trying!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
What do you remember?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I know, father.
If that is your destiny.
Your father he is.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
He might be.  I don't know.
So please don't tell me to can it.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
A decision had to be made.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Goodbye
Now I
Wheeling
...Fine.
And you never got the chance?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
You sure?
It's not that --
What?
Do me another favor?
...What?
...What?
What're we going to do?
That so.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You's the novelty, Champ!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
...Of the truck that run over your face.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
This a con?
...Ten minutes.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Bob.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
...Fine.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
How'd you know?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
A few bucks.
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
I never had good footwork.
Fine... That guy's great.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Let's get outta this stink.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Gazzo's a good man.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Bastards put him on notice.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Maroon, right?
I'll bet.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
That's what you woke me up for?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
I don't work in Toontown.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
Stop what?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
A Toon?  Noooo.
Safe?
Forget it.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
I think you oughta read it to her.
From this box here...
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If my heart's dear love--
By the hour of nine.
And so did I.
Right.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
This is important.
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Who the fuck are you?
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
I still am.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Duty calls?
Just business.
Bloody fucking hell...
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Next.
I think not.  After you...
Of course.
Then where is it?
What's that?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Of course.  Don't you?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
I didn't expect that he would.
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Who's they?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
I never made that claim.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
No you don't, and you know it.
Would you stop with that...
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Finish it!
Nothing...
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
Doing well.  This is?
The Russian would be easier.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
What's that?
What are you thinking?
That's not what I mean.
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
And how do you figure we do that?
Well what are we supposed to do?
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
We've got to go now, then.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
Uh huh.
Two thousand...
No.  It's not.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Has he?
Nothing.
OK.
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
I swear to you, it's true...
You said that, I didn't.
What are you getting at?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Take it or leave it.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
I'm not getting an answer.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Carter, would I lie to you?
No.
Try to land on your feet.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Forget it.
IT IS CRAZY!
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Fine by me.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
Are you serious?
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
Carter...
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
New York City?
Ricky Tan?
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
I know, but --
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Carter.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
It was not my intent --
No.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
This concrete?  This is still America.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
The Feds?!
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
At this point we don't have much.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Yes.
She's fine.
Griffin?  Where are you.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
You don't understand this guy.
Of course.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Okay, we'll order out.
I don't think that's why she ran.
No, I'm not.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You'll answer my questions?
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
Agreed.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Brian told you that?
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
Ya think?
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Would it?
It's for the bell.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
He's got a houseboat.
It sounds nice.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Go to the Symphony --
I don't think so.
What?
About forever.
I do.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Right.
What?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
But he saw you, right?
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Go home for the weekend.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Magic.
Shhhh --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Who is this?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
No.
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Window.
What is it?
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
I don't think I have to now.
It's never happening again. Right?
What?!
You're right.  You better hope so.
She's willing to fly anywhere.
Will she scratch up your back?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Oh, right.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
No.
What about it?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
I think they're announcing your flight.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
So much the better.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Alone?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You've got to help around the house!
You should have helped her without being asked.
Now that's down-right insulting.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Go ahead.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
What happened to your eye?
Never heard of him.
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Sure.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Hey, check it out...
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Hey, I don't play that.
Just some buddies.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
And what does this have to do with me?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
They have. But they never found a lab.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Now that's scary!
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Shit, that was no big deal.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
What deal?
In the shadow by those two trees.
My guess, too.
Keep trying.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
I don't expect to live that long.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Those guns are close.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
PUSH!
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Three for three.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I'll do my best.
There's always a bright side.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
No, no he's not.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'm gonna call her.
Please?
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
I am.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
But I found the money.
No, but you stole from them.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hi.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
No, I read it on the message.
Watch out for that glass.
You know what?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Right.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah, uh-huh.
It sounded like you did.
Oh shit.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
I know.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Hang tough, Lloyd.
Hey.
What?
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
It's a beautiful city.
In Breslau.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
I pay you too much.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
It kind of looks that way.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
What other point is -
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
You did so much.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
What? I can't hear you...
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
Not until you’re dead.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Tons and tons.
No, I don't.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Let us decide that.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
Randy somebody.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
And Joel's pre-med.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Watch your back.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
But who would operate your camera?
The safety what? Fuck that!
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
The young girl is slashed again.
I counted four.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Where you going?
Hello.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Reaction to what?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Absolutely.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
GALE WATCHOUT!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Roman that's not the line.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
WHERE?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
I'm sorry, your voice.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Oh yeah.
Yeah...
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
I'll only stay a sec.
What's that?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
What number are you trying to reach?
So why did you dial it again?
To apologize.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
I believe you...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Please..stop...
YES!
At the airport.
Should I be worried?
Not yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
No you didn't.
Working, thank you.
You coming tonight?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
There goes my chance with Sid.
No, Sid.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Give it to me.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
No, I haven't heard.
Yeah.
You know.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
NO!
And, why is that?
What the fuck is going on here?!
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I realize that.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
What happened?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
I'm sorry, I only...
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
I don't know.
Huh...? No...no water.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Yes sir...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
You've done a lot of growin'...
Well, fust off...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Scar?
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Nine...  Ten!
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
We won't be here...Come on!
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
You'll never get away from me!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Yes, daddy.
Making our very own solstice fire.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
I haven't the slightest idea.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
What?
Yes, something was...
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Writer, is he?
You have the money?
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Yes, I saw it.
Nobody knew!
it will be all right, madam.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
The show must … you know
I don't know. It's a mystery.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
The daughter of his enemy.
This is a different one.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Be still.
Verona again.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Oh, but they can!
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
I like her.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Can you love a player?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Write me well.
I will do my duty, my lord.
I am going to church.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
My hat?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Serve.
Just serve.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Is this necessary?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Not eating what?
We just wanted to speak to you.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Cover it?
Well, then?
What?
Yes, thanks.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Alex.
-- which is --
I think you're lying.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
And now you tell me.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Are you all right?
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
We were just sorting things out.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
You were going to say something.
What about?
No, nothing, sorry.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Two hundred pounds?
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Sorry?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
You get the job done.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
It's a breeze.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Did he sound upset?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
Diseases.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
I don't know, I think...
No.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
What're you doing later?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I know.
Let it ring.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Hello.
Hungry?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
You are.
Yeah.
How is she?
Right.
I guess not...
Pardon me?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Probably the bathroom.
Okay.
Whew.
Why not?
And what?
Did you?
I won't screw you up.
What?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
He's a director.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You were great.
Sammy's?
Why?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- Oh my yes.
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- took a bus.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Now, George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
We live together now.
Go where?
When can I talk to you?
Whether or not I'm going.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Look at the way I live.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Television or movies?
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Yes.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
What do you wanna know for?
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Didn't they tell you?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
No --
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yes I do.


I'll call you back.

Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Of course not.
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't be silly.
It must be something.
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
... Mmm-hmmm.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Of course not.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
-- just wonderful.
No, it's not that...
Do you have something against traveling?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
What?
Yes, Dad.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Yes?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Advocaat is it?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
I'm a Wendy.
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Uh...huh.
Yeah.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Yes.
I think he did it to himself.
Go away.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Susie.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
All the best people.
Oh!
Yes.
Uncle Al-
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Will you marry me, Jane?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Don't call me dear boy.
Good.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
No.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
You know, I just might!
You know what we're saying!
What?
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
What did who say?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
You did what?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Good evening, Vincent.
What is it, Betty?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Because we're
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Three years.  Sister.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
What did He say?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Until sundown.
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I am?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
He didn't do you a favor.
You son-of-a-bitch!
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
You must have missed your mark.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
A diseased monster.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
What?
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
May we look at them now?
Have they nothing to fear presently?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I have others.  All I need is this.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
What was she doing?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Take the reins.
I doubt that's the end.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
They have done nothing of the sort.
And this gives worth to butchery?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Use caution.
She did not do it... please listen...
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
You got any money?
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How did your mama die?
I thought they was.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
I don't reckon I know.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Yeah.
Yessir.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I've got a feelin' today.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get 'em.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Naw.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Well, okay. I got you some.
What brings you back?
So, you're really going to stay here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Can I help you, sir?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
American literature. What else?
What happened?
Do me a favor, will you?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
It's kind of overwhelming.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's crazy.
Fuck you, kid.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Yeah, probably.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
And you're giving it to me?
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
You mean Rashid?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
And?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I owe you something.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
You can't be more specific than that?
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty.
You don't really want to know.
And?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Medium rare, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
Oh, yeh?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You don't.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Easy.  Slow is best.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
And the last...?
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You're right.  I better use two.
You're wondering why I held it.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Sure, anything's poss...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
That's all he said.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Beat it, Buster.
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Where were you guys?
You're right, Joe.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
But suppose it doesn't?
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Down, Daphne!
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
With ME?
That's right.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I am.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
I'll say there is!
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like when?
Oh.
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Shut up and keep packing.
Okay, Joe.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Good night, honey.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
You got some?
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Yeah - Josephine.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
I am Cinderella the Second.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
Thank you.
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
No - funerals.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Yeah.
You're entitled.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Want to switch berths with me?
Saxophone player?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
You have a yacht?
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- opening of the Opera -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Why?
Shell Oil?
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Completely.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Harmless - how?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Talk about sad.
You poor, poor boy.
What is it?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Did you have a nice time?
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Big joke!
You shave with your spats on?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
What for?
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it’s--
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Hello, Katmandu.
I have regrets.
So, what’s your point?
I slept with your sister.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
A wedding.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
You want me to let him in?
Sometime, but not like this.
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
That's right--
What he talk 'bout?
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Yes mam...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
They gone to the field...
Sausage and hambones!
No mam -- I looked all over.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Tired.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Sheet!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
AGAGAH!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Uhh...
Mph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
-Or monkey fucker-
Huh?
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Cool!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Taylor, you surprise me.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
That's right.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Great.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
I understand.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Over and out.
Marry you?
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
I guess so.
Mac.  What's shaking?
One moment please...  one moment please...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Lemme see your ball.
No kiddin'.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
I got a right. You're my father.
The small ball.
He says that to all his wives.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Someone wants to play with me?
No!
Nice set-up.
What if he wants to get out?
What ever happened to just bowling?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
After we eat, Dad.
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Where can I find him?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Sheila, please.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
...lane six. Yes.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
He's my father.
Did you - kill him?
Tell me what happened Theo.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Lips still for sale?
Your time is up, busyboy.
It's burning...
Fletcher!  Now!
What was that?
What if it attacks?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Now!
What team?
Press?  No, I haven't.
Then why am I here?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Jerry?
Harry?  Can you copy?
Nothing, sir.
In the ship, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
You don't know that.
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Sir, about leaving --
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
Good theory, Ted.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
Wait a minute.
And you didn't tell anyone?
Eggs.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
Don't tell me to calm down!
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Why should I go?
I fixed your suit.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
He what?
That wasn't in there before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
But how?
I don't know.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
What's that?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Three to six hours.
Your watch.
I did do that, didn't I?
Do you fear them?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
I never went in that sphere.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
I promise --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Yes you are...
We can refuse to talk.
I don't follow you.
You don't remember that?
What happened to her?
Help me lift her.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
What does Norman already know?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
That's right.
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Huh?
Who's everyone?
Unless it's an act.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
They never used to send a Navy car.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
What do I do?
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Send one squad up.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Don't you have to finish the game ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
It looks like an... asteroid.
Excuse me...!
Zander, no...!
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Excuse me...!
I don't want everyone to see.
Carl can wait.
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I can't help it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Yes, ma'am !
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Flip six, three hole.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I won't quit !
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I wouldn't mind.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Not a problem.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Kill the bitch.
Cover us, Ace !
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Granted.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Thrusters ahead, one third.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker... ?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Go you Huskies?
Yes...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
I...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
...lost the screw...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
What's the scene...
That's right...
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Did as of last week.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Water or mineral deposits.
After Drama Group.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
We had a date.
I've been thinking.
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
...why am I here...?
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Tell it with...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
I'm ready!
I think he's moved...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I love Jewish men.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...Please.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
And you know what...?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Why not?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Yes.
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I grew up on your mov...
I don't getcha.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
I'll be there for you.
Like a big sister.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
I could help with the debate.
Not with my mouth open.
Nothing sweetheart.
Good.  That's very good.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
See, I...
Honey, she won't d...
Why don't you say hello?
Ice cold water.
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Where are you, anyway?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
We're not discussing your age.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Good...Well...Take care.
You're WHERE?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Don't do this.
Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
To make it easier for them or you?
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
A lot smaller.
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Jackie?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Nobody likes a snoop.
How the hell would you know?
See, I know that.
And you said...
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Oh please.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
That's not us.
Maybe he's gay.
You heard me: leave the table!
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Oh.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
No.
My grandchild-baby.
Nothing, I guess…
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
You mean, again?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Tired of this shit...
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
What are you doing here?
That's good.
No.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Yeah.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
I do.
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
No, thanks.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
It's nothing to worry about.
Where does it lead?
I don't want any...
What the hell is it, anyhow?
How much do they have?
What!
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Dissent?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Oh, yes, that's right.
Give that back to me.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
So what?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
What did you say, sir?
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
That is correct, Major.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
Ask away, Major.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I don't think so, sir.
That's close enough, Major.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
Admiral Buldike?
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Look, can't someone help me?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Primary trigger switch.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Can't "Ace" help you?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Look, this is different.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
But I get a red light.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Roger.
Sure, King.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Was it okay?
Okay, whatever you want.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, he's not with a girl.
Watch out for that tree.
No, no.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
What?
Look.
She's in the van.
She's dead.
Yeah, man.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Good. See you later.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
I'll be in the car, okay?
Yeah. So, what about you?
Mm-mm.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
That's what I mean.
Taking care of business.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Ask your girlfriend.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
I hit her.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
So you can give me more shit?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Hey!
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Tim!
How?
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
What feelings?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yes, you do.
Jeff!
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, fuck it, man!
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Like songs?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
You know what I'm saying?
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Well, what about this?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
You do not!
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Yep.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Just one?
I'm here.
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Wayne Gretzky.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Yeah.
Jack...
You sure I'm not fat?
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Don't use big bills!
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
You're kidding.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Ooops, hold on a sec.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Action! The scene starts.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
I've been hoping to run into you.
I didn't.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You'll be waiting for me?
I was afraid of that.
You sure have.
Check.
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
You bet.
Why did she call me?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Who else ?
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
This is fascinating.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Just a scene I cut out.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Come on!
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
This is the right day.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
You're a darling.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I went for a walk.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Dressed for what?
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Is that so!
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Yes, Madame.
Thank you, Max.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
Have fun.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
What do you mean we?
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
But I don't understand.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
She'll forget about us eventually.
They think I have a concussion.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse!
I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Nice to meet you.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Yes.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I allowed it to escape the City.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
For what?
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Criminals.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
I knew it!
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
But Lana, you could --
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
What's that?
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
I don't think you understand.
Columbia.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
A computer.
You designed it?
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Can you do that?
We gonna crash?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
What she call you?
Tell me.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
We already have a super-tanker.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
What??
Lois, I . . .
Lois, I really don't see why --
Everything on it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You'll have to pack quickly.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Wrong.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Yes.
 DELETE IN CUTTING
Shhhhhhh!
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Cuba.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Like me?
Lacy. . . I . . .
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Daddy . . . ?
. . . And  very naïve!
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Something . . . wonderful.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
Bunkers!
Nobody else.
He's thirty-five years old.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
Oh, for God's sake!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh.
Not unless you can fly.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Even that would be an improvement.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
You?! How about me?
I didn't bring any  --
What are you going to do to him?
Tea?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Of course I can. I love you.
And if I don't obey?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Gets you where you live, huh?
-- as we will be.
No! You couldn't imagine -
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Otis...
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
And garbage doors.
They'll soon be over.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Alison Jones.
How are you?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Which one?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
She didn't.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Why are you telling me this?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
It does concern me.
Why not?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
That's because he misses you.
It's natural.
Yes.
For rabbits?
Berries.
Berry-picking.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
That's what he said.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
What, Mason?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Thank you, Nicole.
She...she was a friend of mine.
People who will help our cause.
Indian?
Crafts.
No.
How old is she?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Don't you want to hear?
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Well, let's see what we get.
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Yes.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Yes.
No.
Really?
You mean it?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
It's okay.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Alone or surrounded?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
I doubt that it matters any more.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Why, has he bothered you before?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Are you finished?
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
But not for anything I did today...
- He's got them on him.
What about?
In his apartment -
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
See me in my office.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I made you write a beautiful song...
Steve, stop it please...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Radical.
Cool.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
No.
No problemo.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Unknown.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
But I promised your mother.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Some.
What's that mean?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
No can do.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
What's in those files?
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That is correct.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Did you call someone you knew?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
I wish to say something.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Me? Never.  Never.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yes, you remember.
Do it, Helmuth.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
The Miracle Kid.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Can you handle it?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Just what you see, pal.
All.
We will, kiddo.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
About what?
About where you're from.
What's that?
Molecular-memory.
That's not my mission.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
A girl.  You know.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Kyle...
You're not supposed to.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Okay.
Send a unit.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Like shit, boss.
Shut up.
Admittedly...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Did you?  Kudos.
Please, don't do that...
What... is... happening... ?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
You first.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
What's C.R.S.?
That one did.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Is this you?
What's wrong?
Not here!  They can see.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
It's mine...
Claire.
Yes.
No.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Really?
You shouldn't have.
Will you?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You're part of it...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
It always is.
Robbed?
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
What's all this for?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Like, this way... sort of...
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Where's my brother?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
What gentleman, Maria?
Sam...  Thank you.
What about the house?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Just stay there, Nell!
All night?
Yeah.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
That smell... oh, God.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
Welcome Home.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Then who called me?
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Why'd she kill herself?
No.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Then let's go get you one.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
I sure hope so.
We think?
Come over here.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Okay.
This is un-fucking professional.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
Lookin' good.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Well, those are the breaks.
No, but I know what he means.
Hard to miss.
How d'you mean?
What was that, then?
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
How'd you manage that, then.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Where you get your bank statements.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
What line is he in.
What do you think.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Black market during the war.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Where else?
Good luck.
The L.A.P.D.
Since when?
Susan.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...Uh-huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Yeah.
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
OK.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
So you paid the guy?
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Honey?
Ahh...
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
It was Big Dave's.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Yeah.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Huh?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
What the--
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
What's the combination?
What doors?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
Oh.
What is it?
I'd say we're in its home.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Footsteps!
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Quiet.
Keep the animal quiet.
What?
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
And John?
You loved him.
What happened?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
Behind me.  Over there.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
I have to shoot.
<i>Fiji.</i>
One.
Sweep the harbor.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
That's correct.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Lauren, right?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Nursery?
Yeah, what happened?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
Every time you and Marlon--
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.
I'm not hungry.
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
--we need more charcoal.
So why do you want to go?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Oh, just so.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
I'd ask for identification.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Me?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Yeah, I did.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
He just let it explode.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Before the bomb went off?
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
What did it look like?
That would be my guess.
Your guess?
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
How's that?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I don't know why I think they went right.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Come on!
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
Well, call General McAddie.
About what?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
No.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
He needs to be turned over.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You don't know the procedure.
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Mocky-Lock.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
No.
No.
No.
You're looking well.
Completely unaware.
Now.
Ja, ja, ja.
Give her some cigarettes.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
They're forged.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
They're Harry's.
And my passport?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
It wasn't important.
Two weeks ago.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Martins.
Schmolka!
When did you see him last?
September '39.
Holly Martins.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
I want to talk to you.
Did the police believe you?
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
Here?
Yes, yes, I remember you.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Not when I get interested.
His name?
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
One or two kilometers.
Why?
A bit fucking late.
We swim.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
What??
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Even though his dick is so big?
And belief follows?
You shouldn't.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
I agree.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Why?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
The arguments, anyway.
How did you...?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You do it on the inside....
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve's going to explain it.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
I've got to get back to the --
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
I have an idea....
Are you an artist?
How?
What's that?
Leary?
No.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
What kind?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
I think I'll have a coffee.
Congratulations.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
You're the best, Enzo!
Forget it.  I was joking.
Not at all!
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Everything about what?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... Yes.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Thank you...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I don't know, I just feel it.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
It's me... Johana.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
... Nothing.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
In my apartment?
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
How was your trip?
Way past it.
No.  I'm just depressed.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Of course, that's what they're for.
Yes... It's magic.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
I know sir. I won't let you down.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
I forgive you.
Take a look.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
I don't know.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Sure.
Who?
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --

When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
I don't know.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Not! I tell you. No!
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.

You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
I got into a little crap game.
What! You can't be --
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon didn’t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Simplify and damn.
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Croissants.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
You...  Jesus Christ!
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
I see. How much?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
How many of you scumbags are here?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Good.
Recommended?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
No...
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
So why didn’t he?
Are they still operative?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Cost what?
So... pretend it's not a game.
Yes, my lord.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I thought you were an archer?
Well...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
Not yet!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Yes...
Why?
And when was that?
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
God defeated the English, not me.
No no, I'm fine, really...
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Yes...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
I... I can't stop her.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
Is it long and hanging down?
Go on to the next question.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
The bridge won't wait!
No good?  This is a disaster!
Jeanne, look behind you.
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
That's now what I meant...
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Here -- take this instead.
Don't swear...
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
My king.
No.
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Yes!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Jeanne, be patient.
I want to be at one with Him now.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Let's find out.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Tough luck.
Can you help?
Can you help us?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
It certainly was.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You're out, aren't you?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You'll be deported.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
Yes, it's unholy.
Yes
Yes, I suppose you would.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
He chopped it off
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
She never gives him a turn.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
Then why ain't he dead?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Yes sir.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
I can talk, can't I?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
If we ever get to it.
No, not a thing.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You wanta wait for your share?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
But I got a train to make.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Where you goin'?
What the hell for?
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Yeh, he knows that.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
So could Shaw.
Give 'em a little time.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got a system, Carver?
Let me talk to him.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Just a minute...
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Go away!
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
There!
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
There. 
Why... in the heart.
That's the truth.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Who's your candidate?
No.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I see.  I see.
Slim.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Santa Claus.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Rye.
Maybe it would if I took it.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
There's one coming.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Huh?
Smart gal.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Got a nice evening dress?
Who do you think did it?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
You his wife?
Bonds, sir?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Yeah.
There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
Move!
What about it?
He...he could have been watching us.
What are you doing?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Mine.  Land mine!
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
We're going to be right over here.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
What are they doing here?
It's giving.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
How!?
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Damn.
Just let me rest for a second.
Why haven't they killed us!?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Thanks.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I don't know.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
We got to get out of here.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
What's the matter with you?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I'll try.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
Not very encouraging.
I don't feel well.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
I was lost.
That way.
Maternity ward, huhh!
All right...
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
Go ahead.
You the Bomb Squad?
Where...?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Which one's which?
No excuses, just do it!
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
A bowling alley.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
No.
No.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Nice suit.
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Um-hum ...
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Very well, m'sieu.
You say I am a crook.
Now just a minute, Major--
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Please.
What time is it?
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Certainly!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
But, Lily--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Then you go into the foyer.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
You think that's too much?
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
How do you like my dress?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You would?
Please! 
Call the police?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
May I?
Right!
He started it.
The ship will sink.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Rose Calvert.
...Mrs. Calvert?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
She knows.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Bollocks.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Well, here you are.
May I?
No, no! Just with her hands.
I see you.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
That's enough.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
I think you do.
Montana?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
So you washed it off!
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Thanks.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You said it! How about a little action?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Lose?--I won a little--
Make it five.
Jimmy!
A dollar forty.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll go with you--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Well, let's hear the poem--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Get that out of your trunk.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
He's all right.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
No!
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
"Smooth's" the word.
Sure, Sis.
I was in his cabin--
Let me look at it.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
I asked where you got him.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
You retired, too?
Yeah, you look it.
Enough?  Never.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I'll remember you said that.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right, Doc...
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
All right.  Then what?
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
I made a promise.
I know.  Me neither.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
You'd die for fun?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Well I'm real scared.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Yeah, and dangerous.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
- We all want what we can't have?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Is that any way to say hello?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Political considerations?
Well... If you insist.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
She married a hockey player.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
He tied one on.
Of course.
I didn't think so.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Nice to run into you again.
- The family jewels?
He's killed closer.
Yes, M.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Yes -
- I told you! He was there! -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Kill him! Finish it!
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Go back to sleep.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
I will appreciate that.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Country people got so many strange ways,
He is in his pigeon cage.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Excuse me.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yes Sir!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Oh no, Hannah!
She's sick!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Alright!  That's it!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Huh?
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I finished it off.
You did what?
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
So had I.
Storms?
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
No.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I don't know.
At least she's alive.
Are you going to?
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Helena --
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
You can't make me.
Yeah.
Yes, mom --
Then here's a little bump.
Who do you work for?
She ain't in on it.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
Yes, sir!
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
We agree.
I'm aware of that.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
I have money --
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
What?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You were in my way.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
think I left something back at the -
Shut up.
What?
And don't make any noise.
Are you clean?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Spud, they're my sheets.
No.
No. Me Neither.
Another dab?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
You can look it up.
So who else?
Despite the Academy award?
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
It wasn't that bad.
What?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
No, I don't think so.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Six weeks.
Six weeks and no sex?
Went ballistic?
Homeless people?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Pavel.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Closing.
I don't have a clue.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Oh, please.
But how?
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Transporter room. Status.
MM.?
I don't understand.
Yes, Captain.
Why?
Damn.  Let's go.
To land any closer would risk detection.
A "t."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I'm afraid of nothing.
Am I? We'll see.


Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I cannot go with you.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
To warn him.
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
Hello, Alan.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
They'll start to soon enough.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ok
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Right on the money!
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Stranger and stranger...
Not us, I hope.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Tron...?
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Strategic Air Command.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
How?
Out.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
I thought you moved out.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Son of a bitch!
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
You're welcome.
Sorry.
I adore it.
It's certainly... dramatic.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Not exactly.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
Uh huh.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
And you agreed?
Are we going to die?
Yup.										*
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
You can't have just one.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Get it.
The oriental.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Tell me about yourself.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.
Turn-offs?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You mean she got a bad batch?
You didn't do nothing.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
I think what you did...
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Can you live with it?
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
It's great to hear from you.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
I certainly hope so.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No problems on both counts.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
That good, huh?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I can, but I don't.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
She seems very nice.
Nope.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Not a tiny little vial -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
You do.
He knows something's up.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
What can I do?
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
James, why don't we...?
Jeffrey Mason?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
Flowers!  What flowers?
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
You know -- your plan.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
How did you find me?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
Might be tight.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Nothing.
That's my morning's pay.
Hundred and eight already.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
How much.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Hundred-fifty.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
Open up!
You got the money?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Genuine Draft?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Sheriff Potter.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What does it look like?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You should be more careful.
That a fact?
You're not from around here, are you?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A medicine man?
Whatever it takes.
Where?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
John, please--
I wanted to talk.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
What was I supposed to do?
No.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
You killed a man for no reason!
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Just ran into a little trouble.
I did?
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How do you put a price on murder?
Make it twenty.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
No.
Darrell giving you problems?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's a thick change of heart.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Oz.
For what?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
Give it to me!
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
What happened?
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
...And everything is nothing too.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You expect me to believe that?
You broke my nose!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah...
About things.  About your wife.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
I need thirteen.
What?
But you was going to fight for me.
Nope.  Darrell.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
How much!?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
Accident.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Come here.
I have an idea.
You know what I want.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Don't feel like nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You'd never understand.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
<u>I don't know why</u>!
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Harlin's.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
The old lady?
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Beck's.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Oh.
You use your sleeve.
Rust?
What was that?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
You've misunderstood.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
Like what?
You're skill.
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
I want to sleep here tonight.
How much can you lift?
I lied.
You're secret identity.  That man was right.
How did you get together?
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
I fined 'em instead.
'Course he's coming.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
You want... a free one.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Property.
Yup.
I could run off them whores.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Is... is it... loaded?
Did you... kill him?
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
What?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Lookin' at?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
I got him.
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Eleven.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Three.
Tom?
Well, I come back, didn't I?
No... I meant...
What?
K-k-kill somebody?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
They just said they wanted time.
They ruined me tonight.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
County. I was in for fraud.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Tough break.
I'11 be alright.
Maybe more.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I told the D.A. everything I know.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Right.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
This is totally irrelevant.
I said I never heard of him.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Yes.
Say it.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
What book is that?
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
You would not...?
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
I completely understand ...
I am seventy-four years old.
I...um...
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
What?
Let me talk to Mickey.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
And what are you?  A cop?
I think I will.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
No, no, I'm just...
That's what I am.
Is there going to be a later...?
You, you don't under...
What are you going to do?
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Uh ...
I'm going to help her.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Read me what she said.
What did she do?
The broad has disappeared...
I don't want a mistrial.
... fifty thousand dollars?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
I just saw her.
Hi.  How are you doing?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
It's a long road that has no turning.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
The Big Boy did...?
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
She is not my wife.
Do you live here in the hotel?
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
What about?
You won't have to.
Your name. And --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Ah, no!
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
To complete my cure.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Your accident...
Where were you?
Why?
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Why?
And no birds sing.
The tall trees...
Yes...
Long ago...
What?!
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
What else?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
No... we're together...
Madeleine!!
I won't lose you.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
It wasn't your fault.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Uh-huh!
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
What did you say?
First of all...
Name one.
You're a loser.
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
There's more.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I am not flexible on this.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
There is no candy!
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
I don't think so.
Don't sweet lip me.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
What is her disposition?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Call 911.
I'm calling the police.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
Boyd...What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Take care of business.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
You're sick.
False.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Ball park sausages.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yes.
I think so.
Don't you dare.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
How much?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Have a nice bachelor party.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Nesting?
I'll see you tomorrow...
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
Well, can you come back inside?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
But...
What money?
The only proof is those bodies.
No...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Have another drink.
I think so.
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
Yup.
I got to agree with that.
Greenpeace?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
I do.
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You'd like me to kill them?
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
You have no feelings toward ...
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Thank you, Uncle.
Whatever you like.
Maybe ...
Don't go!
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
That's good land.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Why the bad temper?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
No.
Yes -- very, very big!
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Good, then let's go!
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
On my life, I promise you I will.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
As a matter of fact, I do.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
What's wrong with Parker?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
It was me, what?
My God...
I think I understand what you have in mind...
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
Enough!
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
As a matter of fact, it is.
How did you get your hand out?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
I don't know.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re—Election Rally...
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
No, this is great.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What'd ya think?
Izzat the thing...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Who's got the story? 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
<u>Who</u>?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Eight Days To Go 
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
No rain.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
The War is Over.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
War's over, Pal. 
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
Remember the Maine...
...uh ... No, that's...
Is that true?
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
W...what?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
President's speech.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Where is he now?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's ïretirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
Get on your feet, boy.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
...what is this?
Why are they ...
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Yes.
Fine.  Good.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
A beret.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...of kittens...
Show some compassion.
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
a "pond," or
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
It concerns his future!
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So what firm you with, pal?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Yes...
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
How much?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Upper West Side.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Only if I want something bad enough.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
It's over you, Gordon.
You told him about us?
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
He still likes you
Hi
Good evening sir.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
They're all human beings
I'll come back all the time.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
Then we both are.
Mm-hmm.
What does she look like?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You think you influenced her?
What do you think?  Guess.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
The wives.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
This really isn't a good time.
Oh-kay...
Wait!  Don't go...
Um...sure.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
No.  No, I don't.
You know where she is?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You must have been very proud.
He was so pissed.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She's making this up.
Good.  I'm good.
Well good.  So you're human.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
What?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
Hartford?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
I know.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
Nope.
After that.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Is it gone?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
What kind of whispering?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You know what that does to me.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Shhhh.
What?
It's a ghost.
When?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...Don't get all...
Norman...
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
I will NOT.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
Not personally.
Stop...
Since when?
Your wife...
Claire--
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
She can't be here without me.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
You don't have to do that.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I don't believe you.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Two heartbeats.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
Nothing was ever more false.
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
Who is this...?
You're a monster.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
It wes a dream...!
You - are - a - murderer.
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Like this...?
Always loved you..
I bring her flowers too.
I do not understand...
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
I know.    you are my son -
Harder...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'm glad you're around to say it.
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
No.    This is unreal...
I love you too.
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
Your beneficence.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
No.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I heard something like that
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
And how many people have you killed?
Out - I may be some time
I am sorry...
No thanks - 
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
What's this all about?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I'll be sure to...
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Not ever. Never.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
God, I love being dead.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
You know...take the pictures?
We own a small family grocery store.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Dad, please.
The lesson being?
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Of course we were.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
I miss them, too.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
In what sense?
I guess.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Whatever.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
But you never do.
Let's do it.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Like what?
Forget the store. Think big.
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Seldom? No kidding?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
I do?
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
It's about your parents.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I'd like that.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
You mean he withdrew...
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Eliminate the competition.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
I guess.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
You didn't cuff her?
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Yeah... okay... he did
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
You are.
What brain?
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Curiosity, I guess.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Sam!  Hi!
Yes.  God, Mom...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Yes.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Shut up.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Always hoping.  Or this...
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Try what?
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Almost?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Where have you been?
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
This is Colonel Richards.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
I don't believe you.
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Absolutely!
Nursemaid?!
Elora Danan!
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is he?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Oh sure, Fred.
John, why?...
Just do it!
I thought I was the English.
Yes, sir.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Sure have, Sam.
Maybe.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
You have no right to keep us here.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Something wrong with buttons?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Johnny, what the fuck?
Make that 1790.
He's got my number.
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No...
I don't think she knows.
They don't have any shit.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I wish dawdie was with us.
No --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
To see?
If any!
Goodbye, folks!
Oh!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
I have?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Stop her!
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh! Oh!
Yes...!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Hah!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
But why?  Why?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
They would?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
Yes --- there.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
What was that?
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
That's right.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
You don't neither --
I want to see you and your wife right away....
No, her dog!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
We'll get you together!
Oh --
Yes.
But I still want one.
So who are you?
With this?
What the hell are you talking about?
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
She’s not a girl anymore.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
I know.
I have to go to work.
What are you talking about?
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Where did you get this?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Your father...
How would you know?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Where it can do the most damage.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Don't look.  Turn around.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I think he's going to the john.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Am I free to go?
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
Maybe I'll do that.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Is that a fact?
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
That's exactly why we need them.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
What weapons do you have?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
You do everything Yorgi says?
I was invited. What's your story?
We hung out last night, remember?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
They come in any other styles or colors?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I can see that. Why?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Why you dogging me up?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Been to any good diners lately?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
What are you talking about?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
What's that?
I wanted to talk to you.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Were you now?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What did she do to me?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Baack!
I...
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Good.
Fron kon steen!
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Nineteen, sir.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
What wockers?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Yes.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
There's only one way.
... It's.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
And look at this, Doctor!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
I'm explaining my reasons.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
