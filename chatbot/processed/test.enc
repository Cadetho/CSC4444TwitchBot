There.
I was?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
What do you think?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
What?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
But she doesn't want to date.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You the new guy?
Thirty-two.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Will Bogey get bent?
It's a lung cancer issue
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
William didn't even go to high school
You think this'll work?
I didn't have a choice.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Do what?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
So what did I have an effect on ?
So what's your excuse?
State trooper?
What?
It wasn't like that.
Is that right?
I know.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Why can't we agree on this?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
What plan?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Have a great time, honey!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I haven't given you much of a life.
She said yes.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There'll be a time.
Chief knows.
... and also to bring medicine.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We don't need to know.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Where are we going?
No.  No way.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Is he your boyfriend?
You better get packed.
In the kitchen.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Takin' a bath.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
You thirsty?
Yeah.
So...who's Nicky?
Then do it, asshole.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
Yeah.  I promise.
How old are your kids?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Get in the bathroom!
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
As a plumber?!
You've got a call.
Yes...he's my friend.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah?  What kind?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
What?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Yes.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
When are you coming home?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
I understand.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Half a million.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Partnership?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Who are all these?
You look awful.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Hey, you're right.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
No wonder you're so popular.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Tell me.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How hot are they?
Can't complain.
Let her go.
You sure?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's an exception..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
And then?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Yeah?
Hello?
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Eto Akta Gamat!
The Fifth Element...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Is that all?
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I thought you were divorced.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
At least I won lunch.
This is all that survived?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Anything harder?
What you see is what I got, mister.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
That's five thousand dollars.
I want to watch you work.
What are these for?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Yeah.
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you do with her body?
Keep moving.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
You are a private investigator?
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much?
How much do you make now?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
Snuff films.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Wha... ?
You don't need to be here.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
No.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
I'm here.
Hello?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Yes... ?
I don't understand, who are... ?
Yes, but...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
We're all like that.
No.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
Enough of that crap.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Excuse us, dear.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
What do you mean?
The tickets.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Did everyone call everyone?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
I don't understand.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Well?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
As we near the Pole...
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Yeah.
It's stupid.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Dad.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
So?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
It's just...
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You're not using it today?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
This town sucks.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah.
Well, I never heard that one.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
You read my mind.
They aren't answering their hails.
I prefered the terrorists.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Nine.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
How?
*                     Please tell me your name.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
It's got to be stopped!
Who's that, Ted?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I'd use the word insane.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
I don't want to live anymore.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Do you want to talk about it.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Both pilots!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Hi!
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
That's right.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Lay off, asshole.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
I believe he is probably lying.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
No!  We must do this alone.
Harcourt is dead.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
The human?
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Departmental policy.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Nine meters.  Eight.
And how are we today?
They're dead.
That's right.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Is there a part for me?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What did you think of the music?
No, she's fine.
And how will you make him keep it?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
No! No! No!
Why not?
No!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Stanzi!
Go back to bed.
Really?
I see.
It is miraculous.
What do you mean?
Am I interrupting something?
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
I see that you're expecting.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Hey!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
What a charming idea. May I see?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Ah, love again.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Do you always live like this?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
What's that?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Papa, is this your idea?
No one calls you that.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Put it down!
Yes.
Why not?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah!
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
What exactly are you working on?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Who are you?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Where is your wife?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
It couldn't be simpler.
With the tenors.
And that's all?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
My son, no one can speak for God.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I poisoned his life.
Oh my son, my poor son!
What anger?
What? Who the devil are you?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
He's not?
Yes.
Warn him?
Surely you're not suggesting...
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Is David acting strangely?
It wasn't a lunatic.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
Shall I read to you?
That's easy enough.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'm a werewolf.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Okay.
The next corner we can get a cab.
David, don't lose control.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Now see here young man.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Alex?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
What the hell was that all about?
Yeah?
A coyote.
Shit! David, what is that?
Come on, where?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
What?!
Nurse!
What are you doing here?
Get out of here, Jack!
What can I say, Jack?
What about the zoo?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Then you have some hot tea?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Matt?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Whose death?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
Me?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Why are you so anxious?
No.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Well . . .
Happy now?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Yes, thank you.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
What'll we do?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
No. It wasn't earlier because...
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
I ain't done --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
You have no shame.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Where you boys going?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
The James-Younger Gang.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Of course!  Uh, sir?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
Web's dead.
What do you think?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Yeah, Jimmy?
That he was.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Can't argue that.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Mmm.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
How much did they get from the safe?
This is him.
I want them arrested and hanged!
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
Eight?
Pull out, goddamnit!
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Yes, darling?
No-I can't take the time off work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
Are you my two o'clock?
What exactly do you mean?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
What...is...it?
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Dorsia.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
After six.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
She's my...cousin.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Don't you know this?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Let's see...  That you were with-
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
So who was he with?
I lost my job...
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Yeah, well, you're late.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Isn't that -- extreme?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Here we go.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Milo?
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
We could move 'em up here.
...Hello?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Had you talked to him much lately?
'Have a look?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I think you should go.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
But why would they --?
How close are you?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Does he know you know?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Bring it to the other location.
...You got my E-mail?
I don't know.
So how'd you like the house?
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Who're these guys?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
To my health.
Be careful.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Excuse me?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I'm sorry.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Austin, what's your point?
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.
I'm proud of you.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
There are limits?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... bottle ...
Red ...
Flower ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Rules are made to be broken.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Whereas you are.
Much better.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
And I suppose you're the knight.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Strange.
That's what we were working on.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
I thought you didn't.
You lied.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Have you any place in mind?
Our chaperon.
I see.
Peter's brother?  But --
I shall need a small plane.
We want Mrs. Peel.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
No, please! I beg you ...
The last one you'll ever see.
I was at Harrow ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I want Debbie.
Seventy-five hundred.
Not interested.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Nice shot.
Thank you, sir.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
I can't sleep.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
You better not have too much joy.
Are you okay?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
You're a pimp?
I'll take some.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
You've been having strange sex...!
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Rick, I'm concerned.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
What's this?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Yeah...
Biggest in two battalions.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
In the Field Museum once.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Hey.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
-- What are you doing here?
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Hi.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Got anything to drink in there?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I don't have a story.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
But he killed these guys.
Are you going public with this?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Your brother was a good man.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Fireman shit?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
He's going to be a fireman.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He treats you okay?
He's out.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
-- Burn them.
"Don?"
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Are you sure?
Do you have the money?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
He gots to be did.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
You might be right.
Please, have a seat.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
De-la-croix.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Go on.  Good so far.
Exactly!
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
How long has my father been like this?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
Is that good or bad?
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
This is crazy.
I feel fine.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
I don't believe it.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
What do you mean?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
You tellin' the truth.
Oh her.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...not that time...
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
That is none of your business.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
And his baggage?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Who else can give me information about you?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Why are you shaking?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
Yes!
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
You did Basic here?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
And the bodies?
What do you mean, West's?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
You're lying --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
How do you know?
Where are they!
That bad?
And the problem is you only got three.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
I'm sorry, Bill.
You and the Colonel go back.
Move him.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Something like that. You?
That was kid gloves?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
I didn't shoot West...
You couldn't have known --
What if I don't want it?
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
But you didn't see it, right?
He's not Army, it's not official --
We know.
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Thank you.
No.
You must be Edward Bloom.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
That's terrible.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
There was one time when I was eleven...
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
Like this.
They're your favorite flower.
You don't even know me.
'Fraid so.
Yes.
I'm going to check on him.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
You don't have to.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
I need you on my side.
How is he?
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Is he awake?
Mom?
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
You can see why it's sensitive?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Tell me.
I understand. I'm so sorry
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
Where's the restroom?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
You are throwing me out.
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
What?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Is your niece older than 12?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Better'n me?
Let go of my arm...
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Looks like you know a song.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Not like that.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You could put it that way.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Hey.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What are they doing now?
Some party.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Not a prayer.
Nick... You up?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Hey, when in Rome --
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
What does Charlie mean?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
What's he saying?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
What'd I tell you?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Start it.
You did great, Ichiro.
Someone attacked him.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
I need someone to translate for me.
I still think you're a bastard.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Not in that company.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
He was my partner.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
It is not allowed.
You're foreigners.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
With these?
If he won't cooperate?
Let's go while there is still time.
One man.  He must be good.
Why?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Show me something?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
You equipped for random questions?
What about a summary then.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Next.
Shot of vodka, please.
How long you had these guys?
No.  I got a problem.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Why didn't you go?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Me and my dad.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
What?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Of course.
What about friends?
Twenty.
Is that why you're still here?
What makes you think so?
You like it?
This is my new friend...
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
My office.
Please excuse this interruption.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
I came on a bus.
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Wait!  Wait!
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
What?
What for?
Bites what?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
I told you I've never driven before!
Um-hum.
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
No way.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I don't blame you!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
It was at least as good as the sky.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Is that a birthday cake?!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
You have very nice ceilings.
I love Lucy!
Who use to own it?
This must be very new.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Good-bye, Adam.
You dial nine to get out.
How old do I look?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Good god.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Yes!
If I...you know...
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
I thought ten years.
You came back for these?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see "elegant."
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
To bed.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Or have perfect table manners.
Give it back to him.
What's wrong?
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
What?!
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Never before this.
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
I, uh.
Yes.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
Do you love me?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. No!
I'll call you.
What?
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Where are they?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
So, what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Okay, yeah, call.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
What is it?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You can change it if you want to.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Yes mother.
Yes sir.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What the fuck are you doing?
Mother, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
No ma! No!
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
What are you going to do?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
Nervous?
That was way easier than I thought.
Oh, we're good man.
Nine bodies.
Give the guy a shot.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
They were wearing masks.
It was... It was...
The Greeks. The Italians.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hurry the fuck up!
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Right. The blond guy.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
What does Starsky say?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Is it back in?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Holy shit.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Because my mom gets the bill.
OK. Go ahead.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
They don't?
As long as he gets out OK.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He went back for his brother.
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Sixteen dollars.
Shut up!
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. As a girl.
It's going back down.
Help me move him.
What'd he get?
Why?
Nice to meet you.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Me?
No. Bob did.
Are you serious?
You think he got my license plates?
What?
Why not?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Let's not even talk about it.
What are you doing?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Like silk?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Well, what do you think?
So who's going to know?
That never would of --
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I warned you, Dignan.
Where'd she go?
I'm going to take a look at this.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
You really think he'll remember you?
You can go first, Bob.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Dignan.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Do you have your own room?
Wait a second --
The grammar?
Join the party, fellas.
Why?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
Do you know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
What do you have, Danny?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Who else knows about this?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
So why didn't you kill me then?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
It's just a nightmare.
I should be better by now.
But it ends up the same.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Switch! You drive!
-- not yet --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
It's me.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Sounds like a threat.
We need to get in there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
So?
Someone dead from this household?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Does anyone know his politics?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Rest, William.
I rest.
How many?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Thank you for inviting.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
It's battle I want, not talk.
Peace is made is such ways.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
And the bad news?
Um... can dad come this time?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I blacked out.
Why do you ask?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Yes.
What?
Get out. Both of you.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
What do you want to know, Evan?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Is something the matter?
I was?
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Then you think it might have worked out?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
So what's the point?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
I should have known.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Yes, I'll bet.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Er, goodbye, sir.
You haven't heard my offer.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Practically no one.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I will.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Because you're getting on that plane.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Ilsa, I --
Yes.
Hello, Rick.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
May we proceed with the business?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Victor Laszlo.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
I have my orders.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
What friend?
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I like it fine here.
No. Not me, boss.
No, I don't.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
You?  Personally?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Got to follow the paper path here.
"We're" not over-reacting.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
What will you do?
I love you, Chuck.
Anything else?
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Trying.
What about the sender?
Can you find her?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
I was making a point.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
Cool ropes.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I'm *not* a doctor!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
I know.
*What* will be okay?
Nothing.
Please don't make me say it again.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
That's true.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Did you bite it?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I don't think so.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I'm happy I amuse you.
What's that?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
You're not yet three months, are you?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
*What* view?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Masters of our own destiny.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
How much we going after?
Eight A.M. flight.
Jake --
So that's it...
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Come on. Harder.
I think I just broke my hand.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
That's not --
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
And some new clothes.
You told me to change my hair!
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Do you have something to prove?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
WHAT?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Miles...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Is it all fugasi?
What do we do? We change the scam?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You sell it.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
I'm Bella.
You called the casino a cesspit.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
Not particularly.
You want me drunk?
Where did you get it?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
You're shaking. What is it?
I don't like it.
It's the truth.
The door, Jack.
I hope it brings you luck.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I want to buy a car.
No.
Yes, I know that.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Near the casino.
Your father?
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
Who...
Where do you live, Jack?
She's my baby.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Does Bella come here?
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I make it six.
You want me to check?
What for?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
How do you feel, Jack?
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
Where's the fail-safe key?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Thanks.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Hey, bomb.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Yes, well...
In a second.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Not now!
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Oh yeah?
What's that, sir?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Doolittle, hello?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
She was there...
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Can you help me get her back?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
What makes you cry?
Thank God.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Is the social studies class over for today?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You lost me.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Oh?
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Nothing on Hannah?
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
How long you and me known each other?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
And she bought that?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Hey, Sketchy--
Max--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Exactly.
Does this person have a name?
I'll give it my best shot.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
I was on call. 
For a change.
Thanks, miss.
Huh?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Pick a song, Hawk.
What's that?
Whoa... she is a killer.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
What are you, high?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Could be.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Jam, listen up.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Go ahead, Jam.
Ahh, sunshine.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
That's it?
Yeah.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
What do you want?
Two hundred bucks?
Good morning, mongrels!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
I feel bad for his family.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
How can you do that?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Wonder where we'll be then.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
And what?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Know what?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Where are you going?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
His name is Frank.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
I know.
I... I was playing with fire.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
What is going to happen?
Where is he, Donald?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Yeah.
I was just being honest.
If that's what you think is necessary.
What?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
No more fuckin' for her.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Really, Loretta?
What is wrong with you?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Yeah...
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Loretta, shut it.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
I'm a mirror.
Okay?
Yeah.
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Uh, Gladys?
We need more bars!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
My dear President...  read it back...
"My dear President"...
But you're my father -
Father...
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't want him.
He only weighs ten ounces --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
You told it to me.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Then it's war?
Yes.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Now -- er --
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Yes.
Hmmm?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Yes, I think I can.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no, my friend...
Oh, yes.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Thank you very much.
I'll have to find some more.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
You did not ask me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Yes.
How is your tea, John?
Is it the one you wanted?
The workhouse.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Erik. You don't understand.
Yes -- I believe you do.
Is there nothing men can do?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
What?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
That's terrible!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
What "magic"?
What did he say?
You must help us.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
So?
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's better.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
She hasn't got any.
He hasn't.
You know, my son, our lord said...
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Well! Come on!
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
You've lost your mind.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
It's a tradition.
KILL! KILL!
Well, of course he is!
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
How are you today?
Come up to Boston with me?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Probably see you at the book store.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Yeah.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Take care.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Well, I should probably get going.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
That's scary sounding.
I think so.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
You're drunk.
No, it isn't that.
Oh?
What if you hide me?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
What?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
I scoured the city for it.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I told her today I need to end it.
Is that what you want?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I think she's great.
Um, no.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Tomorrow?
Says you were a bully...
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I just walked in.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
She's so sexy.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I'm sorry.
See you later, alligator.
We haven't checked.
Yup.
It's stopped.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
What's this?
I know what it is.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Okay, we're back in.
How do you mean?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
We can't do this.
You made me have an abortion.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
The voltage looks fine.
Does that help?
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Ballast.
...do you copy?
Coop, where are you...
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
You weren't there. I saw it.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
What happened?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
This is Weir.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
No one?
Yes.
If it worked.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Radiation interference?
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Maybe one of the original crew?
What is it, Starck?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What is it?
Relax, it's casual.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Oh, he did.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
What about his first born?
Isn't that your speech?
We had a tough year.
It's about to be a broken face.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
What's wrong with me?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
He's not responsive --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
You're happy for me and Victor.
What?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Hi, Brad.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
You are a virgin!
Get a ride with somebody.
You're a really good kisser.
Hey, Mike?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Damone, are you there?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
How've you been?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
What should I do?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Really?
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Just kidding. About 10cc.
It was okay.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Does that ever happen?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Dartmouth?!
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
I don't know. I guess so.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Well, you'll find out next year.
If you graduate.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
You look like you could still be in high school.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Are you all right?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Let's have lunch!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Dobermans don't talk.
A major!
Jesus! Did I say that?
How long do I have?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
What are you talking about?
I have to go.
GO?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
What limes?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Lucy is looking for you.
It's gone too far.
Where'd you get this?
You realize...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Stop!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
Stop it.
Oh!
We'll be food, dickheads!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And that's how I ended up here.
Why don't you go check it out?
We're better off.
What now, Geronimo?
Yep.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
What do you mean what?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Nine?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I wouldn't do that, son.
I'll go with ya.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Hurry!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
What's wrong?
And the last one is the...
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
We all have to be strong, right?
We should stick together out there.
I'm not lying.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
'Forgive'...? For What?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm not!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
There've been some calls.
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Aren't you ever going back?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Don't touch me.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Whattaya mean?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Don't start, Farmer.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
What's that?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
There's just one more thing.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Yeah. I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Fine!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Why are these all opened?
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Where are you going?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm back, Mama.
Where are you going?
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
I don't believe so.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You're an outcast.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Materials. Nothing more.
Why... her?
What is this?
This was not taken from a grave.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
You make me weak.
I've no choice
Why the change? What about your work?
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Henry Clerval.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
What happened up there?
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
How come you're leaving?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
How the... did he get in there?
Marcie?
How come?
I had to.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What hath God wrought?
That was the telephone.
Ow!
Jack?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
How about our last jay?
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Looks like a storm.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Anything else you want?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Another coincidence.
What was that?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
What are you gonna do?
Jacob.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
She's dead?
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Who else?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Why are you so agitated?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
What do you think Mom would say?
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Mexico.
What?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Not many.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
She's in the other room.
What?
What does that mean?
Keep your voice down.
Really?
We are?
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you?
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
He needs our help!
That's what I hear.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Of course, but there's more --
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Then good night.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
White House boys want a private meeting.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Just like you would be.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
They're more afraid of you.
Whose orders were those?
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Say again?  How many micks?
Got it.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The first female President?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
He's not going to do it.
So you made it.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
And you think this creature is one of them?
You never said it was off the record.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Your old sweetheart?
Wish me luck!
Did you talk with Humphries?
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Really? A girlfriend then?
I'm sorry about all this.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
I need you to trust me.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
How do I do that?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
"The show must go on."
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Go ahead!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
What does the Omega 13 do?
But you don't?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Yes?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Oh, they're so cute.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
Not a clue. You?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Are they behind us?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Right.
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
But what if Sarris survives?
NO, Thank God he has not.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Wh... Where are we?
What's going on?
Excuse me?
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Because they're coming right at us.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
You think that?
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
They help me understand why we fight.
I only meant...
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Martha!  For God's sake!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
That's a lie!
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Or, 'civilized'.
Then why are you teaching me...?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
Just because they are born?
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You gave him the money?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I need the money.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You positive about that?
You serious?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Depends. Who's this?
Hello? You there?
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
Yeah? Which terminal?
Something shouldn't be there.
But you work for the casino?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
For a movie?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Just a thought.
What?
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
I believe it.
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I got you a copy of the script.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Sounds fair.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
You sure?
You okay?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Harry -–
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Let's not be too hasty.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Like I always say --
How long, then?
That'd be my guess.
That's what I call a payday.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Did you see him?
Who?
But where's the damage?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
That much I think we've already established.
Murphy to Epps.
We hit land.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Let the buyer beware.
You got that right.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
I heard that.
What now?
Pretty low all around.
How're you feeling?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi Josh.
Are you the one who left that note?
Yeah, right...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
How long have you been up?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Did you sign up yet?
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I want to do him!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Ew ... when did you get that?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Go ahead...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
He came into work.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I dunno...
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Hi... what's your name?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
I don't think so...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
For nineteen years...
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Really?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Don't they, though?
That's a terrible idea-
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
But you said they were always old.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
But of course yours worked.
I'll be bait alone?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
I won't.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not even good for me.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Is this the spot?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
You've got to do something!
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
My Fault!
What's your story, Pete?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I just thought --
Wonder what?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
That's a violin concerto.
That's too bad.
I told you, I ...
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
What is it?
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Does she want to be?
Set entry grid.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Ray -- Something's here.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Do you believe in God?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Where is my family?
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
So am I.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
I've read of it.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What the hell was all that about?
What deal?
My troops don't make policy.
Take your hands off me animal!
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Do you want some dinner?
Where is the car?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Yes.
I do.
You do?
Elaine --
GET OUT!
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Let me go.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
Benjamin?
I might.
I don't see how we can.
No, Benjamin.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Yes I am.
One of those outside agitators.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Give me an hour.
The Singleman party, sir?
A single room or a double room?
What? No. Nothing.
Where is it?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
How are you, Benjamin?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Will you come in, please?
Why not?
When is he coming back?
Drink?
What do you mean?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
Like what?
So?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
What are you so scared of?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?
Where is it?
Oh my God.
What?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Yes?
Why don't you watch?
What?
Either one will be fine.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Yes I do.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What novel did you read.
We're talking.
Right.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Not exactly.
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
That's enough.
Why not?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Don't start acting hurt.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Drive down the block.
Where is Elaine?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Sure.
To be what?
Have you thought about graduate school?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I've got to go.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I know.
Quite a while.
Thank you.
Oh yes.
I will.
Hello.
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
But why?
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
What's happening?
Have you a minute now?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I'll pay you back.
Reducing?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Aren't you?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Am I quite strange to you?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
And what do you do -- now?
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Do you understand?
Bless you...
Why do you think --
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Yes.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
Later?
Do you like me better?
Movies?
Can't you understand me?
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Of course -- of course. 
Baron!
I had to arrange about the trip.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Sorry, Preysing. 
Yes --
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Shall I tell them again?
But, Madam. cannot do that.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Me?
-- We must do something...
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Motherhood.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
What is?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Just myself.
What? Me?
Oh, come on, Roy.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Don't mention it.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Expecting visitors?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You must have some money.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
I didn't teach you that.
I can't. I just left home.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Big spender.
I've heard the name.
Where?
Upstate where?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
And hello to you, too.
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
I'm happy the way I am.
That's natural.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Sure. Let's get it over.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
That's that, then.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
What?
What is it?
Ooooh, busted.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Mommy, I'm scared.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Who are you?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What should I do?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Halloween.
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Come on!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
No!!!
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Who else knew I had the baby?!
No one.
It's a bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home is important to a man.
Um.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
So long, Colonel.
Go home!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Excuse me.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Maybe it's time you got out.
Everybody thinks that.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Hello.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
No.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Mhravitch.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Go on.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
They're not engaged.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Penelope!
Penelope!
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Play?
Dad--
Can I help you, sir?
What time do you get off work, my child?
You don't even know me.
Like hugging a lamp post.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
Go on.
You learned this in some college course?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
You're begging him to kill you?
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You haven't heard me yet.
You're old--so old.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
King Arthur.
Cut me open.  Find out.
Was I ever of use?
I'm going to shoot you now.
Can't do it.
What are you going to do?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Jesus.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
How horrible.
What will you do, Colonel?
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
I'm only ten years old.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
Because he was cruel?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Don't!
I know.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
A lot of people don't.
What's his name?
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
The park!
A what?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
Paul's only twelve years old.
Not true.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
We offer...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Man, how many girls do you need?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Overpowering?
The other girl is the star?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Three hundred?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Huh?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
But it's all you do.
Fuck.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
That's right.
What do you mean?
That's like a stag film.
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Jake?
Hey man.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
But I...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Jake.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm worried about Jake.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
Who's that?
Jake'll take care of me.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Could I see your registration?
Took it?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
No.
My door is always open.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why not?
What is that he's working on?
Thank you.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
What's that?
Well, I don't...
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
Of course.
With God?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
But they have.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
How about some candy floss?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
Like a tea ceremony?
And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
No.
No.
Thank you, Uncle.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
You think so, sir?
To pit your own life against another.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Yes.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
We've always been here.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
You knew?
She certainly has.
I... I had a visitor.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
What?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
They were over here, Professor.
Story of my life.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
I worry about you.
Me?? C'mon --
How does he know so much about me?
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
We're on the move.
Sir, may I go first??
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Thank you.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Hey. You: think twice --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Doesn't sounds like him.
What -- ?
Pardon?
You fucking ass-holes.
Oh.
Please. Get back into bed.
Please listen to me --
No.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
That's right. Who are you?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well can I come in or not?
Who are you?
Well?
Later.
Not know.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Hell...
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty.
What happened?
This afternoon.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
You want something to drink?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
This isn't the bedroom.
Why don't you do the same?
What a pretty tune.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
You'd like the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Take care, Dad.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
He's gone.
I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
What did I say?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Not the point.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
I wanna date a musician...
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
What's up?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Anna.
Don't do it, Rob!
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Charlie.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
What's this?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
I dunno.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
But don't you remember?
I think you know that.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What were the others?
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
So, how are you?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
You know, with Ray...
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Let's go home.  Okay?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
You're tougher.
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Hi.  What are you doing?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
No.  Probably not.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I don't know.
Are you persuadable?
So?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
It's true!
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Are you okay?
I'm sure it isn't.
That way.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sure.  Ten cents.
We're not there yet, Justin.
I warned you.
The boy _died_?
-Okay okay.
Do you play?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Jesus Christ.
He called you "MacLeod".
No.
No.  I had to talk to you.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
Yes.
You're using your son's name.
At least.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Yes.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
You killed those other two.
No!
Now there's a new topic.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
What's all of this got to do with me?
It's that important?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Stop.
Afternoon.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
You're a long way from Inverness.
You know me home.  Me name.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You are the same?
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Me arm hurts.
It will take less effort as you learn.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Far away.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Of sorts.
Leave her alone.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Sort of a Jack London style?
I'll keep you in mind.
Oh, it isn't like that.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
The five hundred? Sure.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Get out!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
How long is what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
I'm not working for any other paper!
The insurance business?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You're not afraid, are you?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Now you're talking!
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
I know, but --
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Come here. See if we can move it.
No!
Don't tell me you were worried!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Thanks.
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What!
Who do you want?
They're always after me for interviews.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Hold the phone!
What a chase!
How's everything, Gus?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What?
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
For who?
Just one second --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Pure politics!
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
What is it?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
No -- don't out me off.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now, Hildy --
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
That man there!
Very simple, Earl.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
What good'll it do?
Hey --
How much do you make a week?
No, I don't think so.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
Is it hard?
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I know a secret.
I don't mind.
Bloody.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
...and four and five...
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well, for the baby, really.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
What about it?
Naturally.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And absent bridegrooms!
What's that?
It looks....foreign.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
We did the decent thing.
You might still have a house.
Father, that's enough now
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Can I help you with something?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Great story Goober, how much?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
She looks like she stinks.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
How long is that gonna take?
Oh.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
So.
Why?
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
What'd we here, Georgie?
Not yet.
God damn.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I don't know. I only saw one.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Say my name.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Not in front of the boy.
No!
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
You are a therapist, right?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
What SPF, sweetie?
Did you see that?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Who from work?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
How's work?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Yes.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
And a fact is a fact.
How?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
For who?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
What for? To play Fats again?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Fair.
Can I sit down?
Hey!
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Well, what's so funny?
Oh, I don't know.
That's right.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Hundred dollars?
You name it.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Do you remember where you lived?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you want?
I don't know.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
You built things.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Who are you calling?
No one comes here after dark.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
I take it you've heard.
Better be. You left me for him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Any news on my wife?
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
That's impossible...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
He's trying to impress you.
Really? You don't mind?
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Your son.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
I shouldn't have left her.
Stop it.
How' he doing?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Venice, Italy!
How's the head?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Are you expected?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
Bingo.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
You came back for the book? Why?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Out!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I came here to save you.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What?
Dad!
What?
What?
This is intolerable!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
Dad, are we hit?!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
That was seven hundred years ago.
Why are you trying to kill us?
And why were you trying to kill me?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Just a routine inspection tour.
Charming.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is why Krishna brought you here.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Siam.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
WILLIE?!
I'm going down.
I want to go home...
So now they believe me.
No, not her. Me.
Who?
Yes?
Why don't we go home?
Who are you?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Are you crazy?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I did. I brought you back here.
Sue them.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
That's not a good idea.
What is it?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
Who cares?
...and a license to kill...
Now what?
Eating sushi?
Do you notice anything.
The sand.
What? What do you mean?
Try another language.
What happened?
Yeah. I did it.
You really like that shirt?
You're doing great with her.
What am I supposed to do?
What Happened?
Osaka.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
What exactly?
Be quiet.
Gimme a minute.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
You're a lucky man.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
What is your name?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I didn't do anything.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
**?!! 
What Job?
He's not an ordinary man.
...Foreign service.
What brings you here?
What about it?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Remember what?
Well what?
Oh.
Not you. Them.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Don't do it!
The fresh tuna?..
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Where?
Do what?
You mean from it.
I am sort of scattered.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Why did you leave?
You seemed interesting.
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Ryuji and Gruner.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
What?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What?
This going to work?
What?
I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.
He wants to apologise.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
It is?
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
This the only spare?
The other working.
It doesn't hurt.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
When's the air date?
Get me Wigand.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
I'm not touching my film...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
What caliber is my gun?
How grave?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
No, you do not.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
You eating with us?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I disappeared on you?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
What?!
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Object to the form!
You threatening my family, now, too?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
No!
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Who do you want me to kill?
That's his lawyer.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
My God.
What?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Marylin! What have I done?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
You don't believe in it.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
I don't have a ring!
But?
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
Miles? You're scaring me.
I want to nail you ass.
That's blackmail.
Please! Leave the house.
You were going to have this thug...?
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
It's not something I wanted either.
Pre-Castro.
I was devastated. Of course.
Do you know him?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
You're not...
What?!
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Ah.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I'm not sure.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
She always looked out for me.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Video.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
Yes, sir?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
What's this about not eating?
Why don't you put me in chains?
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
No.
Why should she? After all—
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Beat it! 
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Do you mind putting out the light?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Outside!
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yeah?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
You weren't so bad yourself.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Yeah.
No.
You're crazy.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
What happened?
What'd you give him for the car?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
What about money?
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Whatever you say, darling.
Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
I'm hungry.
I said, the old man's screwy!
Mr. Gordon—
Get out of here!
Don't "Joe" me.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Huh?
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
ain't got a hat—
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
That's right.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
No.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
There were no phone records.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Go on, Willie.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Yeah.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Why?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Dave?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Why?  What's wrong?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Four to six.
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Post Office.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
You know who the mayor was?
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Yes.
Never touched me.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
How many men are working with you on this?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Can I help you?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
You got a good lawyer?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Can I see your I.D.?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
You gain weight?
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
How do you get it out?
How do you feel about getting old?
It's different with men.
Fifteen thousand.
Will Ordell go for that?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Set him up.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
We're partners.
I'm just tired in general.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
He sells guns.
No.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Not really.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
And splittin' with her?
She told you that?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
You said that the last time.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
Buy ya a beer?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Beaumont Livingston.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Managers get ten percent.
Drink?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Four days ago.
Two months shy of four years.
You lived in Japan, when?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Please.
We're leaving now!
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
This one.
As low as two.
What do I do?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Yeah.
I didn't look like a bum.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
We went to the parking lot.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
What?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
You know who this is?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
I see.
Just to see you. That's all.
Hello, Sam.
Don't go.
You need ... a doctor.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
How long had that been going on?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Sarah.
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
What was that?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
I didn't want to wake you.
The room!
What happened to you?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
The best.
What's in here?
What do you mean you can see?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Can't you stop it?
It's gone to the top.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
What? What do you mean?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
Please.
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You look upset.
Don't be funny.
Sit down, Jake.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Well that's good to know.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
Hot. Where do I sign?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Call my chiropractor.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Count 'em on one hand.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Why not?
Can I help you?
Bring it in.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
He's not part of the program.
I don't have all day, kid.
What are you doing?!!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Sergeant!
Uh-oh.
The hull's imploding!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Goodbye, my love.
How many?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Where is...?
Then what do we do?!
Boeman, the ships not here.
Where is he?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
We're screwed!
You okay?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You're so bossy.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Kay-em 14.
You killed him?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Kay-Em we made it!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Leave him behind!
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
You wanna die?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What have you done?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Did you bring a check?
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Did you get him in the head?
He's comin' up -- !
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Can you stand something to eat?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
Where'd you get all this?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
What's that, a ship?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Do I set the goddam hook?
You love sharks?
You're leaving?
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
I don't think so.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
I totally heard you did.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually...
Wizard!
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
What a trip, man.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Why aren't you at work?
Oh.
What is it?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I sort of already have.
What?!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
You're not listening to me.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
You sound shocked or something.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Keith's hot.
You don't say.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Looks like it, yeah.
Yeah, downtown.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah.
I'm cool.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
What happened to Adele?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
His Parole Officer.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Shit.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
78th.
You down with the boost?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Casper, where's Telly.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where is he?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
You sure?
Man we fucked him up.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Tonight?
What is it?
Because your a virgin?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Come dance.
Yeah?
Your a real philosopher.
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Hello?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
By yourself?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
Then let's narrow it down.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
We'll find the evidence.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
By that time the game will be over.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
I know where you are.
Nope.  Nothing.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Now what?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Congratulations, dad.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
For what?
Six, eight hours tops.
That's great.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
We're going to work on the message.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
No.
Feel like practicing?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
We need your help.
You mean like in the steam room?
Doesn't that scare you?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What is this?
You.
Peter...
It could be anything.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Colwyn ...
That's a better one.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You choose these?
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
The Beast will kill her.
No! You cannot know that!
I road them often in my youth.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
You and I will guard the fire.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
You will follow me.
That I promise you.
These we'll pay for.
Go, join them.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
My heart stays here.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He will not!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
You were attacked in the forest?
Modred! Impossible!
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Why do you want to know?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
OK, I'm fine.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
How can you say it?
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Not taken.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Mathilda, listen!
Don't fear.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh? Why?
I don't accept that.
It's impossible.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Yes -- you are.
I know what you're getting at.
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
You're talking to me?
You like to take walks?
I want children.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Why there?
Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Doubts?  About what?
Shit!  He jumped!
I thought you were asleep.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
It has to be a full character's name.
What happened?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
What, come on?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Where did he go?
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Water?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Your color.
Please!
Yes... I'll give you that.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Where are you staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Don't hit me.
That's right.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
What alibi?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
Why would I kill my husband?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
No.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Come again?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Why the hell not?
So everything you just said --
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
What?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
No!
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Why?
How do you figure?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
You really think I'm attractive?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Almost.
Your what?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Yes.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Why do you say that?
Fool's magic.
Fire moat... why do that?
Always.
But I'm hideous!
No more... please...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Or looked so beautiful...
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
It's terrible.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Who might these friends be?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
What know you of fields of war?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
I don't... understand.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
How're these?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Liar!
What shall we do?
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
What happened?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
I can't see a thing.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
What became of the princess?
I'd be honored.
And charmed, of course.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Praise be to God.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Uhm... fine work.
You're with us in battle.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
What are you doing?
What's that for?
He must.
Why?
Did you feel anything?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Where to?
You should stay.
I can't even take a shower here.
I'll get your back.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I don't wanna go.
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
Oh, yes.
A sink?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Well, it's the least I can do.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Are you totally insane?!
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
I know.  Why?
I wish you had told me then.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Sun glasses?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
Can you build a house in four months?
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.
She's a little sad, is all.
What are you doing?
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
I was parked in day parking.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Which?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
No.  Mostly me.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
What's your deal with Alyssa?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Do it now!
No.
What are you doing in my room?
And the baby?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
What are they gonna do to us?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
You're soft.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
He even got my daddy's watch.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
This fork is filthy.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Let it go, Claude.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
What the hell are you doing?
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
'Course I was right. About what?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
How you doin'?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
What do you think about that?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Apparently, your sister died.
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
No!
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
An angel?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
What were you thinking coming here?
Are you dead?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
We're going to Jersey?
I don't know.
See something you like, my man?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
How do you want us?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You missed something special.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Why did you do that??!!
What's your name?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
No.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
Six. I go red next year.
K.
I don't..
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I wish I could help you.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Are you taking me to them?
Will you take me with you?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
What does that water do?
I don't know.
No.
What's that?
Goodbye.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
No, no, no
Are you ready to put him in?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
They're comin' with us.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
It's me...
You like it?
Okay...
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Alice...
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
What's up?
You don't look so good.
His condition? What do you mean?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I want to see him.
We know that.
There's no other bedroom?
Something wrong?
We've met before, haven't we?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
What's that?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Yeah?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
They're gonna cook him.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Suit yourself, champ.
Why haven't you called me?
You still care about me?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Oh, read it!
All of it?
Yes, sir.
What about those men we met this morning?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Good morning, Lovey.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Huh?
Cave, eh? Where?
Leaving?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
And the wine - excellent.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
You have no disputes over women?
They were.
—buy and sell?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
How can we get in touch with them?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Oh, stop it!
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
So you think I'm mad?
I don't need any proof.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
Why not?
What about the others?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A man whose life was empty!
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why?
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Cowan--
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
You do?
I wasn't scared...
Helluva night, isn't it?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
What?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
So what's the problem?
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
What's going on, Kay?
What are you doing?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
So... how'd you hear about this?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Why not?
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Actually, I don't know...
Take it.
No.  Follow him.
Please --
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I put you away --
They were performance pieces.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I go running down there.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
We can't grab it...
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Yes.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Just a nickname.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So?
Oh, Sean --
Who are you?
I'm your son.  I'm you.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Something wrong?
What's so funny?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
If... you have one.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
John?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Right here.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
There's thousands of units like this one.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
He looks familiar.
This your work?
To what?  Trap him?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Are you sure?
Is it the good room?
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Holy shit.
Oh no. What is it this time.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
You're not my daddy.
What time is it there?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I want you to quit.
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
You want --
A bad heart.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Nah.
Spa?
We're with Ruiz.
Any time, bro.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
What? Did she say something?
Is that the woman from..?
Forty-six.
Yeah, I guess.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You know this guy?
What did I 'get?'
Like I said, I don't know.
Back in.
What the fuck's going on?
What the hell did you do?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Nothing, man.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm pretty sure we do.
Float me a hundred bucks.
What do you have left?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
So what do we do?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Yeah. I want it.
I want to leave right now.
Cardiff Giant?
What?
You look good, man.
Drinks are free, right?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
What do you want?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
So you're our own private guy?
A lot of Persians?
What about my keys?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
It hit?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Man live by his rep.
Don't con me. Don't try...
What do you do with your time?
I can't.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know how.
Do you?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I'm in Detroit.
What do you think?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm not made of glass.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Brother Earl.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Just what are you saying?
Is she hooking?
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
500.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
You the man.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Fine as May wine.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
So what about him?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
He told you that?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
I show, you give me the information?
[Reina Rosas.]
[The what?]
[No!]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Drive.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Who's he?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
What do you mean, I'm here?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
So you were unhappy?
What are you doing?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Yes.
Did you used to?
You don't drink like you used to.
Still not a question.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Be a swimmer.
You've done much of this work before?
I don't believe you.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
When?
I like him, Mom.
Our child's safety is at stake.
I think it's fantastic.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ufa!
Who?
Marty.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
You come up here often?
Yes, I know.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Where you going now?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
It's loaded with what?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
What, Ma?
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Sure.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
He coming home right now.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
That's right.
Where?
Look at that right eye.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
So long, Ho-Jon.
What?
You got directions?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Sixteen times.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Y'all just act natural.
Never mind. Forget it.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Wait a second...
I was just asking...
And there it is.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Look.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Even if I weren't.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You're asking for somebody else?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
I didn't have much choice.
You really say the cutest things.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
I have not understood what you means.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
About that chest-cutter...
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
O'Reilly!
Sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
How is he?
Nice.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
You got me.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
The letter.
The letter from John Doe.
Who, for instance?
Plus a bonus.
I can read. I can read!
Hurry up, Pop.
All right, boys, here he is.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Oh, let me go, will you!
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
What?
Yeah, Boss?
The heelots!
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Grubbel's here. See? 
No!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Four bits.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
No.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Hello, guys.
They're not usually graduate students.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
No shit! He's good!
Apartment 306.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I won't get away with it.
How can I help you with the particles?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper...
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
What's the point of this?
National Marksman Competition.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You living together?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
We won!
There's your answer. He's smart.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
And what if you can't live with it?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Who's running it?
God-Damn you!
Why?
You were right.
Wake up?!
No.
Not my problem.
It's not real.
The maze has been changed --
He had access to the keys --
Who did he digitize?
Not his style.
Then how do you know about --
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Connect to public access.
He's on us!!
Is this... food!
Yeah, right.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
I can hardly walk...
Anybody see anything?
Release the power WITH the power.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Simon says...
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Up here, Boss.
What do you mean?
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Well...
For being a bootlegger?
What's the matter?
I was calling yesterday.
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Meyer just finished the books.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I'm glad ya come.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
The kid just called me stupid.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
And the Jews?
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Strategy.
Shuddup.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
That a Jew compliment?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Got a doctor on duty.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Can't you give it to me later?
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Who told you we deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Who is it?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Yeah. What about the second act?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
My friends?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Good idea. When?
Tunnel?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
What!
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
What!
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
A pet shop?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Y-yes.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
It does!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Whose statue is that?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Committee, huh?
Some committee's got it.
Calendar?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
He did?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
I also answer to whistles.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Hello.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Go away, Nosey.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
That's right.
No?
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you want, Senator?
Why don't you do it yourself?
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Jim!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
That's going to be fun.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds?
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes, sir.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
NO!!
And you saw them happen?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What did they say?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Here's a nice place.
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Mary, I'm going home.
A girl?
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
When're you going to see him again?
Sure.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, but you said—
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Sit over there, will you?
Relatives of old man Semple.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Your Honor, I object.
Hang up.
How do you do.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb—
Huh?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Uh-huh.
What're you talking about?
Oh.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Uh-huh.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Mrs. Semple?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Brookfield just came in.
South Dakota - north?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Yes, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
One hundred books?
You must have been concerned.
You can go out there if you like...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
...And I from Phyllis.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Sure I can, Lionel.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Can you help Mom?
What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.
What do you mean?
Why don't you tell me?
Well, look who's here...
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Please... forgive me.
No.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Is it something you've heard about me?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Really?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Lily.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
When?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes... your particular approach.
I never killed a priest before.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Now go find me a big stick.
Altar boys?
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
And what did he say?
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
You lie.
So who's the broad?
No?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Got guts, lady.
Juicy?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
That thing gives me the creeps.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
And what's that?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Where are you going?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Me, too.
Sounds good to me.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Just a waitress.
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
I just want to be a superhero.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
This place is built like a fortress.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Are you coming or not?
Cover me!
Let's go.
Agents?
Sounds good.
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
Here you go. 
Ow.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
Through there!
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
What do you think Napoleon will do?
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
About 5,000 troops.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
And where is Joseph?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Why didn't you wake me then?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
Does your mother know you have come?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
What's your name?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Were you in love with any of them?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Separate bedrooms?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
How do you know?
Of course, my dear.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Does she deserve anything better?
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
And I can go free?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
$247.
It works.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You're welcome, Unc.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't play for no team.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Hey.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Where did Craig move to?
Huh?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Take your car.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
What's he doing here?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
That's my girl.
That's...a comfort to hear.
No.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Could I see some identification, sir?
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
The gun...
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I want'to talk to her.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Everybody does?
You have, huh?
Where?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Only you.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
I'll light the lamp.
You have all sinned!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
How do you mean?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Twenty-five wives!
There's something else.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
I tried to save her.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Now can I tell?
John! Don't!
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Don't you hurt her!
John, where's your folks?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
Did you hear what I said, son?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
What?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
What secret shall I tell?
Sure, that's no secret.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Yes; John's bad.
All right.
About our secrets.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
How's that?
I was praying.
Answer me!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What do you want?
You'll whip me!
The Drugstore?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
No.
Uh-oh...
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
The killer.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
How you doing, pal?
He's dangerous.
Dad -- what you doing here?
Hello Nancy.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Sure, but...
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Get into bed.
Great
Go even crazier?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
He's nuts about you.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
What are you serving?
And you too, Ninotchka.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I see.
What do you wear in the morning?
Just for the honeymoon.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
How are things in Moscow?
You didn't get legal advice?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
The Duchess...
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
We can call our ambassador.
Let's do that.
Get out of here!
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
A week?
Bad news?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
We did it with the best intentions...
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Give me another double brandy.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Confess what?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
What for... why?
What?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
No.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Suppress it.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Don't do it, please.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
You know I want to...
I don't like your following me.
Will you smile?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Make it ice cold.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
She's gone, Leon.
Hello.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
I must ask you to leave.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
I don't understand.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
At Père Mathieu's.
Where is it?
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Yes ... I got the money.
Is it?
To protect his people.
You do it.
It's a code or something.
Mitchell?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
And?
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
May I say something, Mr. President?
That's what they're doing.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Their fourth!
Fucking hell.
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Money.  Follow the money.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I can't ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Winning?
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
... as the old alliances crumble.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Yes, Mr. President.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
That'll be the day.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
How many?
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Sir?
We lost ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
I'll concede in the morning.
I want a divorce.
Yeah ... I'm out.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
When?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
How fresh is this coffee?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
...You ride Winston.
You sure?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
What was the bullet?
No sir.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir. It was punched out.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
I thought it was a car afire.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I got it Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
What did you tell him?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I can't say.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
...You need to talk to me.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Will there be anything else?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Just call it.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
No, one forty-two.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
What did you do?
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
No sir.
Are you jackin' with me?
Nam?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Yeah?
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Do you know who I am?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I'm sorry.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Oh, Betty --
No... what about your sister?
What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon?
No, Del.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Lyla's very nice.
Yes, she is.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Ad lib?
So, call me when you --
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Yes.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Doctor David Ravell.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Were you with him this whole time?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Huh?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Like what?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Now, that's really stupid.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
...among others.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Like... us?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
This is Betty at twelve.
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Did Chloe crack?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Hang on there -
That's right!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Huh?!
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Izzat right?
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Helluva idea.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
So I borrowed it till I did know!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
I am. Hur you?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Zack, we've got to go.
Joe!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Is your brother a flyer?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
He ask you out for next weekend?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Do you go to school?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I can't risk it.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Hey, you guys still awake?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Thanks for covering for me.
No problem, but who's Susan?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Do you know that for sure?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Sid, what happened?
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
One.  Squeeze.
Th --
Fuck!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Everything okay?
'Bout four o'clock.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Nobody leaves.
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
What's going on?!
Damn it!
Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Call Dad!
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Well... is it loaded?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Just a kid.
Huh?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Motherfuckers...
This cool the heat off you any?
Where is he?.
Yeah.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
You got me beat on both accounts.
You got salt last week.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
You're surrendering.
What unit?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Thank you.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Their names, ranks and posts?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
What?
Don't go in there.
And what do they know?
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
That's five, keep going...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you.
But father, they might come this way.
Bite?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Ellie? What's wrong?
Huh?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Ellie--
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Not at all.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's Church.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
I guess so...but...
What are those for?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Shit! Look at this mess!
I just said--
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Wait as long as you like.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I'll drop it!
You have a name, missy?
It's a pirate medallion.
Man overboard!
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Ceremony?
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
A fool's errand.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Raise the sails.
Dead serious.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Why ask me?
Why are brothering with that?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
What's that?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Are you certain this is the right way?
You've seen it?
Yes.
Yes, I have.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
What are you going to do to him?
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Why are there two ottomans?
Icarus?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
What did he want?
You were never invited to my house.
Of course, sir.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Is that so?
I guess I should be flattered.
Yeah.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
You're insane.
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Just look at it!
What's wrong?
How far can you stretch?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
And you have him?
Vermin...
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Exactly.
Certainly. Right over there.
What do you want?
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah?
It has been alleged - yes—
Yes, sir.
—Mr. Schuyler .
Is that so?
Who are you?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
It's the smoke.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Okay.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
What could I be?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
I think you'd better go.
Hello, Smith.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Okay - you remember Joe—
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Did you call, sir?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, hi ...
What is that?
Sure you are.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
It is?
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
Well--it was dark out ...
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Owns the hardware store.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Nothing.
What?
No. I baked them for you.
Can I open it?
Right. And how did she dress him?
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why?
How long do you think you've been here?
There's worse places.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Yeah ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
This is Barry.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Somewhere in Utah.
That's your fault not mine.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Yeah I can't.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Why's it here?
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
I'm going to work.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
I don't have a girlfriend --
It was cool last night.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
No.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
I saw a picture of you.
Sure.
Do you want to pick me up?
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Ok.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
I just wanted to make sure.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
...what...?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
Ok.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
It's a plastic, yeah.
Did you do it?
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Hello, how are you?
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
What is this?
Hi, Lance.
No thanks.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Yes.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't be late.
I know.
Ok.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And --?
You always do.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
I saw the longing in your eye --
Of course.
And he's never once attempted escape?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Shut down?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
It was fiction, of course.
And my own.
But I am history.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
They've taken your clothes?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
I can't
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Louis
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Oh, why is that?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
I want blood
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
He personally asked you to?
Magic
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Not for me.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Don't do this
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
So they're Jews. . .
You gonna watch?
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
May I help you?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Please don't ask me to do this.
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
About what?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Whadda you care?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Nah, she would never...
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
When?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Yeah. At night.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
All I did...
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You did?
Why don't you just call him up?
Sure, what else is new?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Are you drunk?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
He has it. Thank you.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
I'll bet it's been done.
You think I made all this up?
His wife took a trip.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
You think he's getting out of here?
Did you ever own a saw?
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Your Lisa?
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Read some good books.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Gunnison?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
I don't know what you mean.
I knew it!
That's normal.
Stella!
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's just not the girl for me.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Got a shovel?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
How's your leg?
Something big going on somewhere?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Nothing, thank heaven.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
No comment.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Someone not his wife?
I wonder where he's going now?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
But you're not?
Wasn't that close?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
What's happening?
What?
Sure.  It's fine.
Yeah.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
You see any cops?
No--
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!  Shh!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Blood.
Will you let him tell it!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
You sure?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
He's just loaded, honey.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Are you going down there?
John Crawford?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
They're looking for you!--
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
There's only one key.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
When was that?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
They like you.  Okay?
Just a guard.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Get lost.
Wash up and go home.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Plato!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Won't mother be proud.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
It doesn't matter to them.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Why?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
What's he like?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He hates me.
Do you think your father means that?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
I'll never get close to anybody.
What?
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Don't hurt him...
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
You can't find... what?
Negative five?
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No, c'mon --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Ashley, Jesus --
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
You sold him out.
He'll kill you.
You told him about Nick's letters.
He working for them on this one?
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
He wants to see your map.
What?
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
I had better sex in prison.
Samantha.
Her brother.
We walked the place for a week.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Six men means six guns.
...so where is he?
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Cancer-sucker.
Five years. Since it opened.
What the hell was that about --
What about the money?
You knew there were guns in here!
What?
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
Oh.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
What, working security?
No, man! No, no, no!
...for Christmas...
You gave them me.
There is no other table --
That's what it looks like!
Without having them hit the alarms.
Where was she from, Compton?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
What's that?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
How many employees?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Gun shot.
Dead.
What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
So what is it?
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Who shot who?
You can stay here if you like.
What's the matter with her?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
So that was why she tried to run away.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Why?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
He certainly could. About a month.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
You're so nice.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
That's the end of the line.
I found a picture of his wife.
I think he wants me.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Where the hell are we?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Can you feel that?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Father!
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
I got it!
Got a problem with that?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
In about fifteen minutes.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Would you like to see the girl?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
It says, "Ray."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
No comment!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
That's right.
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
He goes to college with me!
Hi, Hank.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
You bitch!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Mrs... Sutphin?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Are we leaving?
Murder, honey.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
You scared?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I haven't got that much in cash.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want to know?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Who the devil is he?
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
But I'm not joking.
Well?
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
Why wait?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But you're always at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Dr. Judd?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
What?
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
That was quick.
Graham is an unusual name.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Does it bother you?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
You're in therapy?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
You went out with her?
What... what are these interviews about?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
You just ask them questions?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Why didn't you tell me?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
So you do fantasize?
About me?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
How come?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I'm babbling.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But that was part of it?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Don't do that.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
John?
Something wrong?
Well, are you?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
You son of a bitch!!
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Not really.
Yes.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And what?
Will you stop? Jesus.
No, I didn't.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Because I wanted to.
It looks like a tablecloth.
So what's my share of the dress?
You want me to leave?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
How did you find me?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Doing what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
So make an exception.
I've got to get back to the office.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
John Millaney.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
I like the way he dresses.
You trust him.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Plenty of room for two people.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
He said immediately.
He'll be really mad.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK. But late.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Gonna cut me open?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Huh?
Yeah? What do I do then?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
How's Brad?
Introduce yourselves.
When do I get to see Brad?
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Poor Brad.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
Our field.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THAT MINIMAL
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
The fuck was that?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah.
Hi.
Anything I'd know?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Don't open that now. It's warm.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
If that's what feels right.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Nice, huh?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
You should call her.
Right now.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You have to tell me --
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
That's thoughtful.
Please, Miles, please.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hrnrnrn?
Want me to drive?
Look at this!
You broke some.
Well. That about does it.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
She got anything good?
What was the bottle that did it?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Where are you?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What are you thinking about?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Daddy.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
I don't feel much.
I see.
I cursed.
Chicken Teriyaki.
He was only a year and half old.
Me too.
Oh.
Bimboo?
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What was the first thing?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
And three weeks.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Forget it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Going to Turley, was it?
He is that.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
Who is he?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I took out thirteen dollars.
It is that.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I thought we talked about that.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Who's the owner?
You really are a gambler.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Of course.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Where is she?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
"Forever".
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
-- You can't go in there!
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Really?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Excuse me?  Start?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Because obviously she existed, right?
So you did meet her?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Of course.
You're with me to be close to her?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Hello, Hal.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Is she here?
I know what you mean.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
Your mother couldn't make it?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Do I know you?
I know what you're up to.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
I don't understand.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Hi.
Good morning, Simone.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Are you calling me?
I forgot your name.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
You use needles?
He hates me.
Why?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
How often do you see them?
Cats?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
You weren't a paper champion.
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
No, we're not.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
You were great in the play, Cole.
What are you thinking, Momma?
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
You see ghosts, Cole?
They want me to do things for them.
I don't know how else to look--
Alright!
What's a "little while?"
See?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
No shit.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
"And a slash-slash there --"
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Throw me one.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Look. You want to talk about this?
Suzie --
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Like your guitar break.
Shit.
No. What…?
How about Brenda?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
All the rib eyes?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Driving?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Mississippi's the other way!
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Let's hit it.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
What kind of a guy is he?
Absolutely.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'll do it.
Order up!
Six. Got it.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Liquid gold.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Then don't.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're outta motion lotion.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
Talk to me.
I'm here.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
I think you're just yellow.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's the point, Dickey.
Five thou.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Did he give you his name?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Ww... uh...
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Man, that's great.
I've got concerns.
I'm not doing cocaine.
What'd you say?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Where's Israel?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
So how we lookin'?
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Got hit twice.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Can it work?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
No?  Who am I, then?
Where's his body?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Why would you let her to do that?
Where's Sartorius?
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Why?
No.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll go with you.
Rheya...
Rheya.  Not here.
Is it a planet?
I like that too.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
Rheya.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
What are you taking?
Why do you say that?
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
But "nice".
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Are you okay?
They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.
I'd miss my life...
Long enough.
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Nothing.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass if falling.
What are you talking about?
You got no idea...
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
What about when she identifies him?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
How do I know that's her?
Let my kid go.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
Does it have a human name?
I'd never admit that.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You'd feel what?
Peter?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Absolutely no class.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
No…
Like it?
Imagine how I feel.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Do you... live around here?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
That's right.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
105-353.
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
What is this? This is water?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Do Grable.
You're crying, Animal.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Ach so!
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
We have no radio.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
That's where he's going.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Left behind?
Well, may we have a look around?
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Aye.
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
Understood. That will be all.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
.          .. Spock's tube...
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Not exactly.
Did your collaborator know?
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I'll go...
Captain, what's happening?!
Mr. Scott...
Sir...?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
What's wrong?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Yes. And I know you.
You would have done the same for me.
What about surface life signs...?
No, sir, no response.
Indisposed, sir.
David?... David!
No.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
But -- why?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What about Spock?
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
I still don't under --
... taking Genesis away from us...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Maybe...
David. Please.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
I saw it -- !
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Well done, Commander.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
He's on a build up to detonation!
I'm trying, David.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Let them eat static.
Well?
Inoperative.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
They knew just where to hit us.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
That's it?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Spock!
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Indeterminate life signs.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Fire all phasers...!
To Earth. To offer testimony.
It'll come back to him.
Now wait just a damn minute.
What did you say she was getting?
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
Shields, aye.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
I buy that. What about him?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
... an offlander?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Sometimes I do.
Chase me!
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Can he breathe under water?
Yes... that looks like them.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
You're not going to launch anything until...
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
What kind of concerns?
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Fail-safe?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
You've not aged a day since then?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Sir?
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Counselor?
Wine, women and song.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Initiate launch sequence.
It's Cochrane.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Not yet.
Do you know what this is, Data?
Isn't it better like this...?
Vulcan?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
I am the Borg.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
What's still there?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Why?
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Emergency override!
Report.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
No!
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
What is it with you, anyway?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
We're explorers not diplomats!
Are you carrying a surgeon?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I was nervous -
Where IS the conference?
But if she's cloaked...
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Aye, sir.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
An accident wasn't good enough...
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
What the -
We HAVEN'T fired -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
Direct hit -
Trouble?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Beverly, come in.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
So... To happy endings.
Now, you make a toast.
Data!
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
What is our approximate distance?
If you wouldn't mind.
How could I not?
You're not here.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Do you have life support?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
I'll take care of it, sir.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And the Senate supports you?
It's not quite the face you remember.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Were we always explorers?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I won't defend my life to you.
Why are you here?
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Intruder alert!
How long until we reach the Rift?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
But surely...
Benny, there's nothing there.
I make maps.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Recognize this?
It's real, George.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
It's in a green Mustang?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
What?
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?!
Good.
Which way?
Smile.
Who?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
A drink.
I...
It was yellow.
No... The closest...
Why?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Goodbye.
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I like this music.
I do not want to.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Good morning.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I know how to gamble now.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
My grandmother's rich.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Tell him I'm not here.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Yes.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
Judy, that's stupid.
Hello...
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Jesus.
You have to go.  I mean it.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
No.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Naawww.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Your sex life?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Sleaze to peddle.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
What's his name?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I thought we were friends.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
No more, Lenny.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Tell me.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Mace... you're a girl.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Just Lenny.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Yeah.
What?
Excuse me?
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What kind?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
We have another one.
From the grave?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
How long ago?
Huh?, sir.
I was looking for a pattern.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Don't you touch him.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Don't be too harsh.
He's called a couple times.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
But why this pattern?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
I don't know about that.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
What do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
It does.
How?
Like what?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
The poor thing. Six years?
On the table.
You have to lay it on the table.
Huh?
Well, who represents you back east?
Why not?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Listen. I had a great time.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...It's really getting late.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Unless she comes back first.
No problem.
It's a gig.
Oh no?
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll give you an eight. 
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It's unbelievable.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Cut that shit out.
I know, but...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Let's just leave.
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
We didn't do so bad after all.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
She was hot.
Don't remind me.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
This version doesn't have fighting?
No. Doesn't that suck?
...the Copa, in New York...
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
What the fuck..?
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
It's on.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You take care of your family?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
For bravery.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
What was that?
Will you give this letter to Michael.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Then the legs at the knees...
No.
How is your father?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
How's Mom?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Where are you going?
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
What is it?
I do renounce him.
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Is he alive?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
What? What?
I'll come down.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
You know, a primer.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
So tell me.
Frederico!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Who is it?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I'm well, thank you.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I never said that!
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Are you okay?
What about Cortina?
Dickie did it.
Very.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
So you found Peter...
This is spectacular.
Which is?
Randall.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
So -- are you travelling under R?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
A ragione. A ragione. 
I can't later.
That's good, isn't it?
No.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
What did he say?
Are you okay?
Was that Meredith?
Peter, I... I...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Postmortem?
What about Thomas Ripley?
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Nah, this'll be fine.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Huh?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, I'm serious, really...
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
For a fee.
Stick up?
I have.
What's your real name?
Iris.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do you understand why I came here?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I sure hate to go alone...
Have you tried the telephone?
Got your license?
So whatja do now?
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Oh?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
So howsit?
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
Spit it out.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
You'll stand by me?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I see you got the telegram.
I think  it's worse  now.
You first.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Sir, that is true.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I do.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
No wallet, huh?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Who... are they?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yes?
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Yes?
I'm here.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Then I'll call you a cab.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Here, one of mine.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Can we get him to the hospital?
You smell gas?
I... I don't believe this.
I was decorated.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Oh.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Miss Hayworth?
Cathy?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I was wondering...
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Would you like some brandy?
San Francisco.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
I did.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Could I have a puff?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Try my best.
Yep.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
That's where the Brenners live.
Mmmm.
Where would I get a boat?
Yep?
The little Brenner girl?
I need her exact name, you see.
Young woman cut herself.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Gulls!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Yes.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Tell him about the party.
I don't know.
When?
Where's Mitch?
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Not by the thousands.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I didn't break that window!
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Yes.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
Right next to the one you already had.
Yes, but...
Oh. That. Rome.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Why?
What do you want ?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I do different things on different days.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It smelled of the fire.
So they united.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Hear!
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It was like that yesterday.
After the gulls attacked.
Melanie, Melanie...
And he'll talk?
Yes.
How soon?
What were the crows after at the school?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
We need them.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm only a student.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
Well? And are you not a good student?
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
A doctor?
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
It might be an interesting case.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Only Brother.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
But can anything be done for her?
Where is it? This place?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Wrong. Answer.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
Erin. Who?
They botched the execution.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Please. Come inside.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
I don't like horror comics.
All day.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
All together?
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Honda 250, huh?
I can't beat a Triumph.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where's Star, David?!
Where you going?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
You have a T.V.?
Thanks, Grandpa...
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
What's that smell?
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
Lights out, Sam.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I was here first.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
I'm making you a sandwich.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
You can't let anybody leave!
Finish what?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
The dogs?
But...
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Now hold him.
And if anyone tries to wake me...
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
A couple of hours.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
We're on fire!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
What's...
We going to make it?
He might just wait us out.
Then we go after him.
So what do you make of it?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
The air... the power.
No...
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
No, we created the Morlocks.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
We make them see what we wish.
Why would you let me go back?
Why?
You took her because she helped me.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
May I help you?
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
You promised me flowers.
Well there's something new.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Heavens, look at that now!
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Where's the challenge in that?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Oh, that explains everything.
Why?
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Mara --
Mara...?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
And roosters.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
You won't even try?
We'll see about that.
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
You ok?
In where?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Yes.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
How did you come to know their names?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
What should they be looking for?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't know.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I don't understand.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
What do you mean?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You know how to get there?
I tried to kill my wife.
Becker does? Are you sure?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, how'd you get here?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
What?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
I've been better.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
No!
What kind of gun was it?
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
You're a bank robber?
How?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
You're in Oklahoma?!
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Maybe.
Why now, Jimmy?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
How come he let you go?
Thelma!
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Louise.  Where are we going?
Which part?
Yes.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Will I be?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I said all that?
Louise?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Shit!
What in the hell is it?!
Then let's not get caught.
Yeah... sure did.
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
You sent that?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
What's so funny?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Uh-huh.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
You know, clean the pipes.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Who?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Here's the info you asked for.
Stalker, huh?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Are you... an architect?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Fine. Fine.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
I guess.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
You want her dead, don't you?
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Hey, hey, hey!
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
You know, I really should take your card.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Oh... Sully.
Thanks for picking me up.
Hm?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I'd go with the seven.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Magda!
Where's Puffy?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Oh, are you on the team?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
Jesus...
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yeah.
This is from the Highest Authority?
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
How's my favorite President?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Dean Rusk!
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Bob?
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Jesus, you alright?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
What?!
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
1868...
This Clear Moon's house?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
X21, give me a 20.
X22. Read.
Good.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
No.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
That's true. What are you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
I want it understood.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
In that order?
You ever fly an F-14? 
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Do what, show you a good time?
What?
Hardly ever.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
What truth?
What does it mean?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I know exactly what you mean.
Well?
Yes sir.
Remember one thing.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Let me do the talking.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Like what?
Did what?
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Come on, we're next.
What the hell is this?
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
I was a victim of circumstance.
They should have warned you about that one.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
Skipper, you can't do this!
Mav's a great flyer but....
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Who is the best.
Just below ten thousand.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
Bad?
You didn't help.
He's a good pilot.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
You think I should quit?!
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You may not think so, but you are.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Where's Kuato?
Shit!
Why not?
Hey, Quaid!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where is he?
Shit!
I've got a lock!  There!
I don't know.
Well...What do you say?
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
I'm not your wife.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
...What?
Hauser left me a note.
She wasn't really my wife.
I'm not falling for it.
I said get out!
What can I do?
I don't need Kuato for that.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Aliens built it.
What's wrong?
How much you think?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Howdy, Rhonda.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Road's in!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Civil?  I'm civil.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I have to talk to your brother.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Oh really?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Chinatown street gang.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
So what're we gonna do?
...What do you mean?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
...Jesus!
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
I embellished.
I embroidered.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Racist asshole came at me.
But why?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
...I'm dying out there.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- Roger --
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Bobby's got it.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
What?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Where's Hap?
How come Jack let's you work here?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What do you mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
The usual, 9:15.
I don't know what to do.
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
But I love you, Laura.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Right on time, baby.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
I understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
No.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you get this from your lover?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Who am I?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What did he find?
Four cases in three years...
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Gruber...
I...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
...of Anesthesiology?
Ed Concannon.
Objection!
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
...things change.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
Maybe I can do something right.
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Who told you that?
It's over!
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I understand...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
What?
Who have we got?
Admittance form is wrong.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Doctors.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Me, too.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
You look kinda lost yourself.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
We will, sir!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
So?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Just be careful, okay?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Like what?
Doctor...
He was just here!
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
You okay, champ?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Seemed, not was.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
He would have loved this.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Why didn't you drop any sail?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
What was that?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
We all have problems.
But that's not the point...
Jesus.
Good.
It was so real...
My dad.
That's how he died you know.
You all right?
Shouldn't we turn away?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
You're officer of the watch, George.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
I don't.
What?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
What are you blubbering about?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
What makes you so sure it was one?
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Fuck me.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
That is my permiso.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
And?
What brand'd she smoke?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
So?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
I do.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Who knows, baby?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
There's worse places, honey.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Fan works.
You sick?
Yeah?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Santos... It isn't.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
What?...
No.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
How are you, Crabtree?
She's a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Trip??
He has a book.
Not Curtis.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
What's to tell?
Excuse me?
I've been trying to finish a book...
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Vernon.
Hello?
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Heaven?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Thank you.
What'd you tell him?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
But... ?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
How's that?
So where have you been staying?
Where's that?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
How can you tell?
Maybe she didn't come here.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
So, why did you take me up there?
I eat.
When?
I'm a little worried, James.
Yes, James.
Thanks for that. He all right?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
James Leer.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Would Walter really press charges?
James is... I don't know...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Who's that guy?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
A jockey? You mean, like --
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Something wrong with that?
Annette? She's good... tense.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
I've got some good news.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I wasn't feeling well.
I could take you downtown.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Why's that?
Are you sure?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Does he?
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
Walter?
Yes?
No way.
I'm still thinking about it.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
I'm afraid not.
I don't know.
You mean my problem?
All right.
Nothing.
What else?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
I'm all right.
I'm talking about you.
Very weird.
What's weird about that?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Something happened to you.
The morning?
I never hurt them. Never.
Twelve years in prison?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Sounds like a special guy.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Nothing. It's over.
What?
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Okay so far.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
How?
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Hi, lady.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
SHIT!
Cab One, radiation readings?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
I'm thirsty.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Shall we go for a swim?
Find anything?
And why do you tell us this only now?
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm not coming.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
And what are we going to do now?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Don't you ever paint men?
What other boat?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Unfortunately, no.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Through someone else?
Because I'm getting fat.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
That's not what he meant.
Why?
They were stained.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Everyone.
Right now?
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where'd it come from before that?
Not at the moment, no.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
Why not?  Mmm?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
And you're unhappy.
I'm always bad.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
Oh, yes.
What?
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
What else?
Do you know who put it there?
Yes.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Do you remember what just happened?
Agnes, can you hear me?
And the passage to the barn?
So she sent you?
I hate him.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who are you?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I believe Agnes is different.
Who?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
What?
I'm only interested...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
About what?
Your niece!
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
And what has that to do with it?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Become?  One is born a saint.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For Agnes.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
I'm concerned about her health.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Before or after you killed the child?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
They're yours.
Are you now?
Yeah.
Sure.
I'll murder that Lennon.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
You do - repeatedly.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Grotty?
I beg your pardon?
Did you look in here?
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you pulling my leg?
Yes.
What's that mean?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Yes.
Ah.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
And we're looking after him, are we?
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
What's he know?
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
My eyes are lighter.
Is it? Is it really?
And?
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
But John hasn't got any.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Oh... God... am I cold...
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Looks like a derelict.
I'll go first.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
You want to try?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
<u>He</u> died.
You like this shit?
Where does that go?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Where did it come from?
Boy, that's terrific.
How's Broussard?
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
It will be.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
We're not going anywhere.
How many?
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
First contact...
What's the frequency?
What's wrong?
What'd he say?
There, it caught!
I thought I'd find you here.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Take us up.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We won't need it then.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Which presumably means...
Yeah... I forgot.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Let's get back and call this in.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Minh...
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
What's happening?
Where're they headed?
Not yet.
Oh, man...
Deal.
Yeah?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
And...?
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back-out.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Six month stint on Datus.
You have to...
'Bout five minutes.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
It wasn't meant to be.
D-day.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
What do you take me for?
A dull cliche.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
We never met. That's why.
Feeling better, my dear?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Bill!
Huh?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
You're my girl, aren't you?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
She did...?
How is Eve? Okay?
I'll check with Eve...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
I mix what I like.
What a body, what a voice.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Never try to outguess Margo.
I don't have to. I want to.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
But she just got here...
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Oh-oh.
Hmm?
No.
She's loyal and efficient-
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
Late for what?
Miss Harrington...
What for?
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I wish I could believe that.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Harrington.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
I'm glad Bill's back.
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
What's so funny?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
That was way back...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
She's your understudy.
You'd have been proud of her.
That's beside the point.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
What's your being married got to do with it?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Anything to help you out, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Answer my question!
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
July of '71.
Anything you've got.
Go on, go on--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
Who?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Morning or night?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
You can't.
I didn't do anything wrong.
But you know who did.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--and we got a guy in Justice--
Absolutely--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
What happens when the baby comes?
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
Look, I told you inside--
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
I have nothing more to say.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Where?
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Anyone but Bernstein.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
What did you just say?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Yeah right.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
There's our man.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Ow, what the hell?
That's stupid.
What the heck is this?
I know, Dad.
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Dad!!
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Yeah, bring it on!
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Let me know.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Ready for what?
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Okay, explain.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
What makes you so sure this will work?
They're coming!
No wonder he let her go.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
You on drugs? Huh?
Before the coma!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Not that I know.
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
You never thought of the possibility?
Now just get off the train.
I'm sorry.
Don't let me go!
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
I'm getting a chest cold..
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
I had nothing to do with it!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Perhaps you could convince her?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Who are you?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Alvy, I...
What-what-what-what's the matter?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, you do?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Neat, yeah.
Well, who's Sadie?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
God bless.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah?
Okay?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Those are the two categories...
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Well, have you ever made love high?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
M'hm.
Yeah.
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
It's his name.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Yeah, where is the spider?
Is he in the bathroom?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, good. Okay.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Step up here!
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Bad?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Are you?
I mean that as a compliment.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Probably on their first date, right?
It's a narrow view.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Yes.
Whatta you mean?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
M'hm.
And... uh-
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
SO?
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
M'mmm.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
I was very charming.
Had a little help?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
You don't have any clothes on.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Honey?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Really.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
It's not a contest.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
So?
Lucy overdosed.
Monica.
There's a test, you know.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
I mean, you're really back.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Otis!  No barking!
Not properly watered.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Cal, too?
Sure.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Do I put you off?
You're an interior decorator, right?
A little out of my element.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
And you know, he really does not.
Scout's honor.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
I like you.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ready to go?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Yes.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Very.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
She's all over him, are you blind?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
No.  Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Thank you, Panes.
What did I do?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
You weren't exactly horrified.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
And you are...?
Divinely?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Z!  what are you doing?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Who is that idiot?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Affirmative.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
What did I tell you?
What did you do to your hair?
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Twenty-seven.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Two o'clock.
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
No -- I don't want anything.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
What's her first name?
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Who'd care?
For me?
Thank you.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
What?
I don't?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
I don't know.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Where is your apartment?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Well, I have things to do --
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
What about him?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
That guy really must've belted him.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
It's a thought.
Yeah --
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Dreadful.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I like all of them --
You're out of your skull --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
No.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
Call me what, sir?
Charlie?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I only met Kurtz once.
Our Recon flight ?
Ours.
Spooky.
Yeah.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
No -- no, Captain.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
You're Australian?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
I'm sorry to hear that.
What?
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Had?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
I'll go into town with you.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Surviving is what I know --
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Been driving long?
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
You don't feel cold?
It was blown up with the plane.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Don't bet on it.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Thought that door was open last night...
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
How was it talking to him?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
How long has he been having problems?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
So you'll be at work?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
It's one idea...
I'll never forget you said it.
Were you asleep?
You know what? I...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Good night.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Help!
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
How's Verdell doing?
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Now we'll both call him.
Not it at all, really.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Another place where?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What are you doing?
Michael?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Yeah.
It's not the same, is it?
I killed him.
Why?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
How did you get into the business?
Why not?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Why?
That's fiction.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
Not even a stalemate?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
Then, we wait.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
What?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What happened?
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
Why?  I don't know.
It happened to you before?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Why?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Why not?
A dime.
Anything.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
A coke, if they have it?
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
You guys having a go a me or what?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Fifteen crowns.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Nope.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
No, not yet.
What happened to Katka?
You capitalist pig!
I don't want to ruin your day.
You're kidding.
Did you see anything in the files?
You don't understand, I can't!
Yeah, pretty well.
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
That's my mum's.
No!
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
I've been around.
Really?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yep, it's all yours.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Okay?
How?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Seems a shame!
What's the Bugler?
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
But I have to finish this....
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Later.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
And what of these foreigners?
She asleep?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
That's over. Way over.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
A late night or an early morning?
Late night.  You?
I meant he's a doctor.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
He wants to talk to you.
I'm thinking.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
I don't make small talk --
You don't know me.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Like me.
What the -- ?!
I'll get something for us to drink --
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Or anywhere where people might see us.
I don't want to be just your friend --
I have to get you home by one.
We're doing something -- ?
Stand right here.
Come on.
When did you build this?
Mars.
I should have told you sooner --
Can I -- go out?
Landon. You go on home.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
I'm no dummy.
Where did you get -- ?
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Here's your jacket!
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
'Bike fine point?'
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
And where am I gonna be?
Maybe if I used my left....
What?
March 11th.
What year?
Oh, right, right... 
A mall?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I know.
That's all taken care of.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
I run this place! 
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Suzy!
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you.
Yeah.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
What for?
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Hi.
Well, stop the world.
I know.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
I can look and see.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Don't.
I don't blame him.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Really?
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Just gimme a chance.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
What crate?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
What is it, Tommy?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
She was killed, Penny.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
It's too dangerous.
Stay here, I'll be back.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
So where's Buckaroo?
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Chet!
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well that's what he said.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
He's a great writer –
I don't understand-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Yes... Isn't it?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Charlie. How are you.
...Got a sweetheart?
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
I hope these are your shoes.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
You're leaving?
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No... Can I come in?
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
It's okay... It's okay...
I apologize, Barton.
Fink.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Yes sir.
...Okay
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Home. Watching TV.
No.
How's not smoking?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
She told you, didn't she?
I had him in two classes.
How long were you having sex with him?
Yes, you do.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
Because you didn't love him --
She wiped out her whole family.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Why does he do it?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
No.
How'd you get in here?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
You workin' on another book?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
Why not?
What do you want?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Who are you?
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I need a dealer.
They're just words.
What?
Not what?
It's Andy again.
Who's that?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Your people.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Hi.
That is amazing. What year is it?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
OK! Goodbye!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
You're not the Mayor.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
Nope, I told her everything.
No.  No glass on the inside.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
It does to me.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
I was just hanging around.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
She knows who we are.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I see you knew him.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
But he's never said a word-
Like hell you do.
Impressive
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
No gun.  How disarming.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
He ran away?
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Maybe they're right.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Why's that?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Wacko? That a technical term?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
To kill me.
That kid is amazing.
What?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
You can't-.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
I got family. ...Please.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
How'd you find this place?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Do you sail?
What did you see?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
What are you talking about?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Oh, Bruce...
You are on drugs.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Alexander... I know you.
HOLY SHIT!!
You okay?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Do we know anything about him?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
It isn't working any more, David.
Go ahead.
Let's get a coffee.
Goodnight Annie.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Say that again, son.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to ....
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Welsh again.
Well, there is that ...
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Butt-snatch...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Chief, look!
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I don't think we survived the crash.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
<u>You</u> left me.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
I feel really stupid.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No.
Our cemetery?
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Beetle!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
W... What is it?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Why not?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Viridian?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
<u>Oh my God</u>!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
You don't have a key?
Is this the key to the attic?
They don't want to come down.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
No, Robert.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Yes. I am.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. I like to watch.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Yes, I understand.
I certainly do.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
I see, Ben.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
What about money?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Sid, it's useless!
... What do you make of all this?
Clearly, yes comrade.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
No, sir.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Tell her you need to see her.
What's that?
You fell in love with her first.
I need a shower.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
The monkey.
You came up here looking for the portal?
People make mistakes.
Holy shit, yes!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Is that true?
Why not?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
What'll you have?
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
This is important!
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Hello. Wendy.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No. Don't be an ass.
What kind of circumstances?
Says who?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
No you mustn't, my child.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
We have to meet.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Who's calling?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Stay in him forever?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Bad dream, darling?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Folks came.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You on your way home?
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
She likes this dress...
Out where?
I don't know him that well.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Jesus.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Sethe?
She left me. She's gone again.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Hiya Allan.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Excuse me?
What the fuck is he talking about?
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
You're not interested in sex?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well yeah...I know that.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Uh-huh.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What the fuck are you--
So who--
Huh?
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
It's your roll--
What the fuck is going on there?
"Our" car, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Then what's...
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude here.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Dude.
'Scuse me?
Well we--I don't--
WHAT?!
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
I said out.  Now.
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
Impressive.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What is it with you people and pain?
I'll heal.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Each day is a little life.
You're hurting me.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
Your security's for shit, kid.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Whistler!
Don't try to talk --
I don't buy it.
You're not going anywhere.
You're blind --
Hold out your hands.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You used me as bait?!
There is no cure.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Just get out of here.
You care about him, don't you?
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
I was afraid that might happen.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
LaMagra --
But you use blood banks --
You've been listening in the whole time?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--and if she ever did--
No!
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--how old?
Yeah, so?
So says her website.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
What?
I can't.
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
You want a hand?
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
I don't know yet.
What? That made her lose the baby?
That's what Josh and Mike said.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
For "James?"
--Graduate Thesis--
This isn't about us.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
What is all this shit?
You planning on sleeping out there?
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Cotter'll kill you.
You gonna be alright?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Yeah.
Domini.
I should check on Anna.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Your mother's pastor.
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Yeah.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
...Huh?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...Who?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
Remy.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
...You know that car?
What's the matter?
Sign.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
If the pay's right I'll do it.
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
Has Ray come in yet?
What.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Are you Detective Williams?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Can I feel 'em?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Do you like talk like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Are you a bad boy?
Come on Dorothy.
You. what?
I did. are you?
Yes.
What?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yes.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
How is Central these days?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'm here, aren't I?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Okay. thanks.
You want to tell me about it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You want to go talk to him?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Dorothy Vallens?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
I see.  How much?
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Yeah.  She told me.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Oh hey, one more thing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Good night.
Because I got caught.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Oh my G-d.
Diego?  It's George.
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Please, continue.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
It's beautiful.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Jesus Christ.
Not in front of the kid.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
What are you doing here?
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Okay, George.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
I understand. What's your question?
Sail.
Third group.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
It's true.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
And how many are we?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Are you ready, colonel?
You got something on the coke?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
So she knew about his heart?
What'd he die of?
The official cause?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Aren't they all?
You've been following me?
Objection!
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
And how are you now?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Yes -- several times.
What did she say?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
What happened next?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Why'd you come here?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Can we get out of here?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I'm the photographer.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What?
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
What are you going you doing?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
This is not relaxing.
Really.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Yes.
It's more involved than that.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
That's too bad.
Did Marsh use it?
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Nobody did.
Did we want to?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Carolyn!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Lemon?
He's very... clean.
And clean.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You want to go back in?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Are you all right?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Why doesn't it scare you?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But it's not the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
What made you ask such a question?
Wonderful. Uh...
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about Bari?
I can't do this, honey.
What are you doing?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
You feeling better Franny?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I can't sleep.
Want anything special for dinner?
Hmm?
Oh my God...!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Then what do you care?
Died there?  How?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
'S up?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
I said, no thanks.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Jimmy, you've got --
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
What it will be.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
All the more reason I should be here.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
I can't.  Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Let me see it.
What are we doing down here?
That's the past.  It's dead.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I didn't sell it.
No way man...
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
You haven't?
You gotta use your imagination.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
That building?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
All right!  Where's the key?
I think you're fucking crazy!
The money!
Sit down, Gino!
No!
Gimme the gun.
So, you just got out?
What?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The money?  The money's gone.
He didn't see you, did he?
The hell I can't!
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Where, then?
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
I saved you.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
But everybody is all right.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Cease, can I ask you something?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
I knew it.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
The redistribution of wealth.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Because it's the truth.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
You mean Shelly?
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
For what?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Gino Marzzone.
Yeah, twice.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
He does it right in front of him.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
okay, all right.
Hey.
Oh, God.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
I'm going to Paris.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What do they want me to do?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
You have your passport?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Paris?
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Did you?
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What does that mean?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
Looks familiar?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
xxxxxx
This your store?
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What?
Tell him we're busy.
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
...Yer nostril?
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
If I can help you ...
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Ah ...
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What's she done?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Take her off the list.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Why not?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
I'm going to open it!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Don't do anything silly.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Don't worry.
I delivered it.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
A woman eh? I see.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
what? ... Oh ... 
Now look what you've done to him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
What?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
For God's sake, what's happened?
What do they want you or?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Sleeping in the back.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Dead.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
What's his name?
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
What?
He's very very sick.
Is there any chance?
Yes.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
No.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
It's early for him.
Whadda we bring?
Frank!
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Don't push it, Larry.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Shut up a second...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes.
It's not loaded.
London.
Hold it down, okay?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
We can cut back at the end.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
This isn't friendship.
Don't say anything about anything.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Okay.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
What is she shooting?
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
What did he say?
Bad manners.
Yes.  That's right.
That's okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
...good-bye then.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Because you're nuts.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Hello?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't you work here?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
Are you nervous, Walter?
What!
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Hi Walter.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Why not?!
Here you go, enjoy.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Don't ask.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I know, man.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Where'd ya buy that?
People seem to like my cat.
Well...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Did you see my cat?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Are you done with these?
I don't think so Mayolia.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
T-tell him that?
Good night Walter...
I don't think this is gold.
Let's move out!
It's coffee.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
I... feel.... pretty.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess.
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
You okay?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Hey there.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
I don't understand.
No, you didn't.  When?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Hi.
Why'd you come back?
Thanks.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Meet me at this address after school.
Sporting events, yeah.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
But you threw a knife at my head!
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
How can you keep doing this?
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
All right.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
Cassandra's really smart.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
My parents have money...
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Well, I hope so.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I never thought of that.
The homelesses?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
You said "Crash".
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
How ya like that?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
That's great!
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I want to be had.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed him!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
How come you don't like me?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
I'm going to the Show.
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
No way.
She's playing with my mind.
I gotta go now, Dad.
Can I give you my testimony?
Ain't he warning up?
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
Jim looking for somebody.
Thank you.
That's right.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Excuse me.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
What?
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
...very difficult to get in.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Okay?
That's right, yeah.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Yeah.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...position...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
We need this guy.
Why not make them happy?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It's nice isn't it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What? What?!
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
It's under...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With what?
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
I really think you're -
This is not the way to treat people.
...worst possible time for me.
Well, I... I never tried.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Mm.
Yes.
Well, I've been busy. 
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
What're you gonna do?
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Nothin'.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I did what you told me to.
Yes, you did.
No, he's not.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Promise?
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more!
Wow.
Get up.
It's up to you.
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Take it easy!
You sure?
Denying?
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I know it, I know it.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Yeah.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
Are you sure?
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
She has a real spirit.
You're kidding.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I loved you.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
I still have one left...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Spooky.
Hey, you're anti-male.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Next time, call...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
Where do you think you're going?
Taking messages.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
How do we get back to the freeway?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
I thought you said you could handle him.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
What makes you say that?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
What are you doing now?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
Hey drop it, okay?
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I can hear you again, clearly.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Not a chance.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
No.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
They put their hands all over me.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Do you think they'll walk away?
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Some loyalty.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Seems like it.
Call me "Nels."
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Yeah?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
It takes all types.
Then why doesn't she?
How?
Yeah?
Stop it, Dil --
Jimmy.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Someone recommend you?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
And what's it like?
Jimmy.
You know.
You want me to ask you in, right?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Someone out there.
How different?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Dil --
How?
When?
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Happy now?
Why, honey --
Shouldn't be, Dil
So it's true, then?
You like me better like this.
Don't call me that --
Why?
What?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You killed my Jody?
More endearments.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
You don't know that.
I know.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Jude?
You sure?
Thanks.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
A hotel?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Right.
How did you know it was her?
What's that?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
No, what's the funny thing?
What the fuck am I doing here.
Can't. Once I signed up.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Yeah?
Why?
Do you?
Don't think that way.
I told you not to talk that way --
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
What?
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
I think that's what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
When you come on, you really come on.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
With whom? Where?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
I heard you, I heard you.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
But --
No.
Carson?
Café.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
What now?
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Not my room!
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.
I think Tex did it.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Not unless we're blind.
Mrs. Lampert --
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
You loved him?
Where did he keep his money?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Up there! It is up there!
But he is gone.
I'm not sure I --
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Are you in the book?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
En garde.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Yes -- that's right.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
I've never seen him before.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What?
I don't see him.
Yeah?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
That's impossible.
Hi honey.
What's wrong?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
I'm not.
You found her?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Did you warn her?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
You gave me a 'D'.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Someone tried to kill me.
FINE. Are you?
What?
Stag?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I got to get home.
They're not picking me up until six.
That's not why we broke up.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
That's what he said.
Why not?
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
You ok?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
That wasn't me ...
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
...shit.
A little early for a delivery.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
...and fair...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
I need your truck.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Go on.
That dog was mean before I met him.
You'd better coast through...
...-er.
...-er.
...-damn!
 Nice job back there.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-er!
...you.
Oh, shit.
I know the likeli-...


...yeah.
I'm a dangerous man!
Oh, no!
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Listen, Arlo...
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...or my conscience.


Reach into my pocket.
Yeah.
 Okay.

Okay. 


Forty-five seven!
What?
It's working.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

You.
Thank you.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Yeah.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
...without compunction.

Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
Thank you.
Is it--?
Any of them Richard Long?
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...-bility.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
You look good, Richard.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...and the government.
...always done, Richard?

I can't say it's a surprise.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him.

...-ther orders?
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
 But...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
Odd, then, that his car...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
Where's Arlo?


I can handle it.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
That little geek is my...
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...is death.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Yeah, I just....
Forty-seven.
You find yourself wearing a...
So you don't remember...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...side!
Oh.
Look at that.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
They're calling it an accident.
Do you know him?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Avocado groves?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
No thanks.
Sure thing.
In the garage.
I'll just tell my wife.
Okay.
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core club.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
You've done well by yourself.
I get by.
I'd like to talk to him.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
What pictures?
Yeah?
Where?
What's the maid's address?
What for?
Give you three minutes.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Do you know where she might be?
Not that Mulwray?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Mr. Gittes.
No. I'm just a snoop.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
What's wrong?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
And I want to know where.
Including the death of your husband?
Okay, give me the keys.
What about?
What does it look like?
Upstairs. Why?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Where can we go?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Who?
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I never was.
Sure you do.
Yeah.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He owned the water department?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
Apple core?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
What are you doing here?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
Father, I have sinned...
Elena!...But when...
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
And the notice?
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
You've got some on your face.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
How old did you say you were?
Would you sing for me?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I really think -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Thanks.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Get Dr. Corey.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Why not?
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
First of all - 
I'm drunk.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
What's this?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
I know, but -
Thompson!
Well, thanks a lot.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Am I sure about what?
What's this?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's not the same.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Excuse me, but...
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Yeah, but not in here.
Such a sordid state of affair.
I was here the whole time.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
So you're really getting married?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
But you were.
There's more, isn't there?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
You're serious. You want to date again.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You're such an asshole.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Are you open?
That's easy to say from over here.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What smells like shoe polish?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
No, thanks.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I think it's safe to say yes.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
She's in here?
Nudie booth?
Which ones?
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
I can't close the store.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
Reach what?
What, your dick?
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Let me borrow your car.
Because I'm here.
You're happy to get a fine?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Who eats cock?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Make them change.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Do I know you?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Lasagne.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Be careful.
The porno mags?
Here. Now leave me alone.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How many girls have you slept with?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
All right. Name it.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
It stings a little.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
Did he say "making fuck?"
What part of Russia?
I hope it feels good.
And... he told you all of this?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Bye. 
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Answer the man.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
A monkey?
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Take the gun.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You couldn't.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
What if he can't?
What are you doing here!?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
What was God thinking when he built this place?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never, what?!
Don't let me fall!
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
What about you?!
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
No, he's gone.
You said there was a way across.
Oh, my God!
Right.
Ask the questions.
What did you do that for?
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
I've been cured.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Alex.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
What crime did you commit.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
What do I want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Let me get up.
Alexander de Large, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Something like that.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Don't read it - sign it!
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Four in this block, sir.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You like being a lawyer?
Bottega.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Max, the cab driver!
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
What?  What did you say?
I picked up a tail.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
You guys been holding hands?
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
Try?
I got caught up at work.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
What's he sayin'?
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
How long you think this'll take?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max.
Good.  Help me out here.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What are you doing?
Music.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Who's that?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
No.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Doesn't cover everything.
Dmitri?
Why?
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
No, not just that.
That's what you said...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
People do have heart attacks.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You want something to drink?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Who?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Never, but I've been practicing.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Did you see the van back there?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Realized what?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Love at first sight?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
How did you know?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You made your decision yet?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Can I talk to you a second?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What?
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
J39 Z186...?
It's beautiful.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
That isn't the way it works.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Why don't you come back with me?
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Greenbank?
Champagne please.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I don't think so.
Really.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
But --
Git movin', I said.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
No.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Gotta have kings.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
But, Luke...
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Man, it's so hot.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
What?  What'd I do?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Who is this?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
But it's a different m.o.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
They all have one...
I was.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What's Abba?
You messed with the scene.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Have you seen it?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
It does.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
Please finish your story.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Crash victim?
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I did this already.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Ecru.
Are you sure, Dear?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
I'm really not that hungry.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What if it's got a pattern?
What are you looking to read?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
Tell the doctor.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
It's TV heaven.
Not yet.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You got wine. That's great.
And all the plans we have.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
No, you've done a perfect job.
I love him.
Here's the ring.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm glad you're doing well.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
What does that mean?
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
And for my help I would get what?
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Turn on the flashlight.
What for?
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
No, I didn't.
Yes.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What the hell is he talking about?
Me?
Mr. Taylor?
Anybody know about that car outside?
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
How do we know what room she's in?
The money isn't here.
You're not helping.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.
Did she break your heart?
Sounds boring.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Do you think you are a real master?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Do you know her?
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You're not married, are you?
I've missed you.
You're doing calligraphy?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Give it back!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
She needs direction... and training.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
You buying?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
You don't say.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
How 'bout the morgue?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
You look like a rock star without a job.
In a better place.  I hope.
Well, how's your friend?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
I can see her.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Neither.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
We've got company.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Have we met?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You what?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Junior.
No.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
That's none of your business.
Oh please.
I do.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Good for you.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
German.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
No.
Did you hide the letters?
Who is it?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
What year are you in?
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Need any company?
Don't you want to change that?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Hi, mom.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes!
No.
Ronald?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Yippy.
Shut up.
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
Bad time?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
I'm not in the mood.
I want to fuck.
Why so nervous?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
I did?
What time is it?
You're a lucky guy.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
You get your wish!
What song, dear?
Sometimes.
Are they nice?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
It's early yet.
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
What do you want. Amy?
No, I didn't.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
You'll always play with me?
A princess?
That's right!
Merry Christmas.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
I like stories.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
What?
Hurry!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
No.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Maybe he's just shy.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
And she got the medium.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Hello?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
I'm cleaning my stove.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I guess you'll find out.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Knock what off?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
On your desk.
Oh, it's nothing.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Briefs.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
Everything okay?
No, why?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
What's that supposed to mean?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
I think I'm a werewolf.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
We can get a warrant if you like.
You got a dog?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
You can't believe this bullshit.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
What?
He means the last that we know of.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Police.  Nobody move.
Just visiting my patient.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why give yourself up?
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Yes.
Someoneís after me.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Horrible...
Can I get my life back?
I'm sorry.  About before.
You're a liar!
What happened to you?
What is it?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You're kidding?
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this?
I'm... not... nobody...
Bob...
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
We think so.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
And...
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
He's only doing what you told him to.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Uh-oh...
So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
So what do we do?
I'm afraid so.
A teleprompter.
I don't think so.
At a press conference.
Yes, Mr. President?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Yeah.
What's that?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You bet.
Mind if I sit down?
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
I never thought I'd...
Gasparilla?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Curse?
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
We got a boat.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Dios mia.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
It's because of me.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
I don't think they're in school.
They're townies?!
Women swoon!
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
You know what really excites me about you?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
What happened?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Yawp!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
You really think I should forget her?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
What is this, a midnight study group?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What is it then?
I don't want to read.
Found what?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Todd, what's the matter?
what?
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I'll come to the performance.
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We were talking about my schedule...
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Anti social?
I don't know where it is!
The "come back" kind.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
No...
Let's just keep going.
Hanover!! Hanover!!
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
She's gone...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
What was that?
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
What the --!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Who? Who is?
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Yeah.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Where is he???
No.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Yeah?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Sal.
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman!
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
What?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
You're going hunting?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
Fucking A.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
What do you think about?
Nick, he just came back.
What are you, God?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
Here, here! This is it!
Then lemme have 'em.
Right.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Did you go hunting.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Yeah.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Yeah!
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Technothugs?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You're working a partner on this.
I'm wasting time.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Not the 'T' word.
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
Married?
She's pretty.
What else did he get?
I'm here.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Demolition Man.
You never want to find out.
Yes.
You could always take it off.
I'll take it.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Say ... about the interest ...
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Well, I'll be -- 
Look here now--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Well, I --
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You want me to go around --
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Down, Shep! Down!
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez!
I'll get the doctor.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
We must go on home, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary! Come back ...
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Mary -- Jabez --
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
I want someone to talk to ...
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
You're all right, Argyle.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What's happening?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Who are you, then?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Put it down now.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
What's going on?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Jesus, you're the man!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Well, how'll I get home?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
So!  Sal is with you?
Would you do something for me? Please?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Shit...
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
It's my only chance!
Oh no!
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
What are you doin' in there?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
What the hell you doin' back there?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
He's all doped up.
We're all set at Kennedy.
I must of been outta my mind.
You got kids?
What if I take you with me?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
Would I hire you?
Are you a lawyer?
You all right?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Because I don't want cancer.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
He's gone?
Goddamn women...
... The bodies out the door.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Dead or alive?
To show that we're negotiating.

Sal?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want them all.
Okay - you got your one.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Here's your document, Sonny.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>He killed two children.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Okay.
What?
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
God help us. God help us all.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Really? Did you play in a band?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
So?
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
What?
It's been about a year.
Is it a good morning?
Eddie Lovell.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
I'm coming.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
ML?
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Can you pay me now?
Can't do.
We both do.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
OK.  OK.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
I can run out and get it.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Just coolin'.
Shaddup, Vito.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Some are OK.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Is that what I think it is?
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
What?
She did not.
You're not my real dad.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Owww... refreshing.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
...cause you said...
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Hey, where did you come from?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A raft.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
That's my boyfriend.
You really are a pirate.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
How was that?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
You got the Extender?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
This is horse?
What does Leto say, Piter?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Do you know this my lady?
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
He knows.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
What's in the box?
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
You mustn't speak of...
Those sounds could be imitated.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
It's a pleasure...
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I have no next picture.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Are you sure this is okay?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
I never said I could ad-lib...
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
So why didn't you do it?
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Don't you have any savings?
Eddie, how was I?
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
Isn't he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
You met Basil Rathbone!
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
OUR picture?
Why not??
I got married last night.
How long's he been here?
You look beat.
Oh.  Okay.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
I'm really sorry...
I don't know.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
I thought this was a group effort.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Al!
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know what would be great?
Ed, can I see you a second.
How you doing, Ed?
They tore her dress! ...
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
I don't think so.
Thank you. Can I see her?
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
When? Today?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Are the TV people with you?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
Who?
What?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
What are you doing?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Are you sure about this?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Everybody hates me!
Ohh...
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Really? 
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
No... Could you?
What is?!
Show business.
What?
Screw off.
All right.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Why me?
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Come on, Ma.
Me?! That's you!
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hello.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
That girl's an idiot.
We don't have foibles.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
Yeah, just --
Dick... Dick,..
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Yeah?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Here they are.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Uh-huh.
What's this?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
What?
These are private -- these are for us.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Don't you fucking knock?
How's the left these days?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Yes.  But do you know?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
We talked.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Where are we going?
Yeah, that's Stens.
Lynn.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Thanks, but no thanks.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
I got her address.
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
They shot him in his library.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What about you?
Damnit...
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What?
What's on the call sheet?
What's her name?
I'll take your word for it.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Officer White?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
And Reynolds?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Really?  How?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
I just gave him my card.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
When can you get it here?
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Okay.
They're spooks.
No shit.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
Jesus.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Who?
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
So what do we do now?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if <u>what</u>?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
What are you dialing?
Who's calling?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Well then who can?
Law enforcement?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Do you see anything you like?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Your stuff?
About the accident.
I can't.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No, sir.
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
You should take this seriously.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
I've seen it.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
It's really over?
Sir?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
When do I get to meet him?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Other than me.
For the last four years.
We're screwed.
He didn't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
In your dreams.
Dad!
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Yeah.
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
No.
I don't know!
Listen to me.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Jerry?
Bobby--
Are you okay?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Am I to understand--
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
No.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
That insults them.
Excuse me?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
What am I looking at?
This is not very good, is it?
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Do they know them?
Why did he bring you?
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
What?
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
Which we've overflown twice.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
No.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Thought you'd never wake up!
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Oh.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaules
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
You get Hardy.
I mean home.  India.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I don't think so.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Through a window.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Why didn't I think of that?
That's doable.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Where are you at least?
He's on to something bigger.
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Do you mind?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Oh?
We going somewhere?
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
You stole my luggage? You--
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
True enough.
Let's do it again.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Got it.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You can't be too careful.
Can you see the other PIRs?
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Your share.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
There's always a surprise.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
But would you--would you--
Seen one billion, seen them all.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
--You're a cop.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Call it an expression of trust.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
All of 'em?
You're a lawyer?
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I'm sorry, Erin.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
You're a girl.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I want my fucking money --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
I'll see what I can do.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Why good?
And if you had to guess ...
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
And ...?
And you were told to destroy those?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
We'll see.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
You want my number?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
Great.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I can't leave my job, George.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Next week.
Dr. Paulsen?
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Give me that!
Mine, mine.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
I have felt it.
Our destruction?  Who?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I think we're in trouble.
Han, we need you here.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I'm against that.
You don't look angry.
That was no earthquake.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A mining colony.
I don't like this.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
No thanks.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Thanks to you.
About what?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
Are you kidding?
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
What's going on?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Leia!
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
What's in there?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
May I say something personal?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
He's... near.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
What's the little black box do?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Get this crap out of me.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Locked.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Location.
I said pull over.
Where are they going?
Me too?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where?
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
At last...
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Excalibur! Is it true?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I'm going.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
You.
To me? But why?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What didn't he tell you?
It's serious?
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
A man to see you.
Morning.
Fine thank you.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Sure did.
He didn't mention?
No.
On what?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
In Europe.
What?
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
I wouldn't talk.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
How do you know?
What are you doing here?
So what's next?
I believe you.
Who's in it?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Oh really, when?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Amen.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Really?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Unlikely.
Very much.
I've seen it.
Are you a relative?
How old are you?
What's this?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Go fuck yourself.
How's the birthday girl?
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Fuck him.
You look awful.
No, I mean it.
Says who?
Yeah?
Nice, huh?
It wasn't like that.
Talk.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Oh, brother.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
He's drunk.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What the hell are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Fine.
Huh?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
What do you mean?
Stay off it.
Go ahead.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Charlie called.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
What's the problem?
What I mean is --
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
I said I was sorry.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Go ahead.
Great.
What's with you guys?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Yes, well, they are.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
All right.  Hold on.
No.
It went well tonight.
The Stratford.
Every year.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
History.
So, what happened?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Look, if you want to leave...
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
I didn't want to wake you.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Is that what you used to do?
Older than me.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
So. How are you?
Big piece or little?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
Where am I?
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
And this thing can grow it?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
That's not the worst part.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
So you had a nightmare.
Is someone there?
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Not anymore.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Kim?
You've got someone in your office.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
-- what?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Hey, is that really necessary?
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah?  What do you need?
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
I don’t think so, thank you...
Evelyn, right?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Uh huh...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
All in one tape?
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Well...Annie for one.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Where is he?
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Okay, I’ll take them...
No...I’m not...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
What about his first born?
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Ben?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Apparently I can disappear.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
How's the IPO?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
But I'm not done with the machine --
Yes, thanks.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Are you kidding?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Why didn't you say something?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
It's just business.
Victor, your scar --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
And take a little trip with them...
You mean <I'm> going along?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Then how come it worked loose?
You must carry spare parts --
Such as?
Doctor, what's wrong?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
A what?
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Uh -- what?
I'll never find my way through that.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
What do you mean?
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Unguent.
Okay.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Both of these.
Oh sure.
Uh-huh... A what?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
...Mr. Lundegaard?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, I see.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
No, no, fax is -
Yah!
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Twice.
...Is everything okay?
We might be innarested.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Yah - how are you doon?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Nope.
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Was it reasonable?
It's terrific!
Yah.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well -
That wouldn't interest you.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Really, what's that?
Hmm?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Looks like this is goodbye.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
So you're staying in tonight?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
You hear that?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
What?
Is that what you're calling it?
What is wrong with you?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Who's this?
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Who do you think I am?
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Insurance'll cover it.
What list?
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Where's your car?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Any historical figure.
I said I promise!
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
What... ?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm you?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
What?
I think this is about where we came in.
What the fuck -- ?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Should we knock?
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I'm not following you --
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
This is cheery.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Right. April 25th.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
What's that?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
You okay?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I'm getting him out.
You never been in one of those things.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Why me?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
American.  Come to get you out.
What did you want?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
Meeting ... people.
Really?
I'm sorry.
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
Hello....congratulations.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
But..How could that happen?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Where am I?
No... thanks... Listen --
Hi... Where are my shoes?
A quest?
The Little...
Parry... I'm Jack.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
Parry...
Holdin' my penis...
I advise you to let us go.
What a gyp.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Divorced.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
You just going to sit there?
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
You like it?
What?
Alaska.
Well, you seem very professional...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Like what?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Bye, now.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
None.
I think it's what you think.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
Is he?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
No, I wouldn't.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Aaron, how you doin'?
Why you have an attitude for?
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Then don't go out with me.
Wussup?
I, umm, came to see you.
I did.
I kissed those girls.
Come down!
They are?
What are you going that way for?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
Positive.
So what do you want with her anyway?
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
You're kidding.
Sonofabitch.
Fletch, this is dumb.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
What the hell are you doing here?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Well, which one?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
There is?
So what do you figure?
Okay. Some idea.
Fletch...
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Right.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
John Ultramalensky, right?
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I know.
Why are they after you?
We can't talk about it here.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Why don't you try suicide?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You sure those doors will be open?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Cute thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Preoccupied with what?
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You are a rich woman.
Hi.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
So?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Who are you?
Moved out.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Uh, almost.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Not really.
Frieda's boss.
Yes?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
So what about this watch?
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You're that guy, the private eye.
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Marseilles.
That's in France.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Morning.  Sometime.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
You want the red or the white?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
They around?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Where's Johnny?
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
I'm scared.
Hello?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
29 years...?
How could this be happening?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Murdered?  Why?
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What do I tell them?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I got it.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
John, you there?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
I better give you my address then.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
What is that?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
How about a roll in the hay?
Barely.
Come on down!
Your bed.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Hi.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Why?
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Whaddya mean?
....with a woman's touch.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
No.  No, it's not...
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
But what if they try and scare us?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Will you listen, dammit!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Twenty.
You need to leave.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Tell me.
Tell me!
What are you doing?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I've told you the truth.
About Jessica.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
But she might be in trouble...
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Tell me.
Right.
Where did you get that alcohol?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
You're telling a lie.
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
You had me worried to death!
Can't we at least talk about it?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Rennie...??
We must abandon.
Shut up, Elliot.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
It's over, finished and done with.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
This is how we've managed to last.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What else?
Mystery. Deception.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
See, Daddy.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
We must have been heroic.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
My back is killing me.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Washed away.
This could be it!
They're my team.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I hate the Mets.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
And he has finer moments now and then.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
But you're his friend.
Do you think he can do it?
Yes.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
It is the work of untouchables.
Please! You're being foolish!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
You mean Gandhi?
It's beautiful.
I would rather march.
Who is that young man?
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Assuming we are in agreement?
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
From what budget?
Thank you, no.
What's wrong with him?
I have to know where you come from.
You wish.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You really had other offers?
How the hell did you get here.
Anything I've forgotten?
What will happen to the others?
What do you think?
I hope he's not just a body.
You can wear lifts.
Yes.
Have they found our friend?
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
--when you go away.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
The name?  For the certificate.
And you got him...
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I'm in a hurry.
What do you add up to here?
We'll try again.
Hi.
You okay?
You want to drive?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Assumed name... Houston.
Fatter... some things never change.
Wait... give me a minute.
Really?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Do you trust him?
Why didn't you tell me?
He must have.
How long ago.
I'll bet you can.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
That would be the first time.
You can't trust anything these days.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Can we make it?
Who was it?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Where we go in1?
Two years.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
Good evening.
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
We went about together.
Could you do me a favour?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Nasty.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
You've been watching the film.
No.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Right.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Who's Brumby?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Ta.
You sod.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Did you sleep well?
Do us a favour?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Still got a sense of humour?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Eh? Have a drink.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
I'll see you, then.
I had to.
They did.
It's too...
It's not.
Nurses.
He is?
The nurses?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Just the act.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
What could somebody get for them?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
You didn't?
What did you say?
What?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Oh, yes, George.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
So I'm making it concrete.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Why?
Where did Moss...?  I...
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Mmm.
Who told you...?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
Would you come in here, please?
Under him?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
And what if you don't close.
Alright.
What are we going to say?
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Can't do it.
Because I say so.
It's not impossible.
Yes.  I hear you.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
Was it?
Uh-huh?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
No, his wife is.
Rick...?
Me.
What do I...?
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
And when was that check cashed?
She wants her money back.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
I'm...
The deal.
What?
You going to turn State's?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Three.
Yes.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I can help you.
That's right.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He will grow strong.
Ready, Frankie.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
...Who?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
Beautiful.
How long does this go on?
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Was it a boy or a girl?
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
I don't think that's necessary.
Yes.
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Michael.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
I just left our friend in Miami.
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
We'll try.
And?
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It never crossed your mind?
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
What do I do?
What have you done with him?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
This David's a friend?
Did anyone laugh?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
No.  I could have, though.
I never thought you were.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
No.  The girl.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Run for what?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Do I have any other choice?
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
No.  I expect you can't.
What rumors might those be?
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
What about?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Get out of here, Ray --
You got no choice. It's over.
How is he?
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go --
How's that?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Not my girl anymore
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
What for?
It just ain't happening --
Got it ...
What about him?
How you doing, man?
Forget that ...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's a good one, Donny...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
No.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
You goin' home?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
You okay -- ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
Dad'd be proud --
The era when crime didn't pay --
Sure, man --
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Call 911 -
Call 'em here -- ?
Mitch.
On account of Mitch?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Ready -- ?
I take out my slim-jim...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
How old are you now, Toby?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
What do you want, shithead?
No more shines, Billy.
What did you hear about that thing?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
What are you talking about?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Nah.
I better call again.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
Where'd you find such creeps?
Are you okay? What happened?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
Who'd you call?
Why not?
Oh...
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
How much money you got?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I'm not sure--
What class did you say that was?
History.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Yeah, can I help you?
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Of course.
What's that?
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Will.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Sean.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
My kind of background?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And confuse him--
Hold on!
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
What?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
285.
Tell me what you really think.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
You've never been on a plane.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
My wife's dead.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
What?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
You suck.
I'm Will.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Not a chance.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
I want to meet them.
Promise?
No.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
No.
How do you know that?
I can't go out to California.
What am I scared of?
At least you have a mother.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Maybe the road's out.
Gallon or two?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Why, you're the preacher!
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
And you ain't ashamed?
They never wrote you nothing?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Want to work, do you?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
How about a lift, mister?
Goin' far?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Yes, ma'am.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
No plants.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Got any more, Ma?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Then what, Tom?
Yeah?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
You can have this for ten cents.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
But what about this?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
What's this?
Morning.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
You do not.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Bob...
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Hello...?
Flowers. That's funny.
As long as I get the laugh.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Lisbon?
One cannot love and kill.
Throw that away.
All of it?
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
What's a revival tent?
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Doesn't matter.
What?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Everything under control?
The point was to love each other.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He's still sitting in that damn field.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
I'll take care of it.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Why should they?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Why?!
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
I don't understa-
Where to?
It's so cruel.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Diane!
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
What does she do?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
It's warmer than I thought.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Hey, darlin'.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
You ever miss it?
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Snoop onto them...
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Dead.
What did we learn in school today?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Shit! Come on!
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
That's bullshit.
What's this one eat?
Yes!
What?
I'm Crash Override.
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
And you have to smile.
Thank you.
How?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
What?
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
My name is the Plague.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Thank you.
Hello, operator services.
Real charmer.
What?
Michael Myers.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
You think she stands a chance?
Get back!
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You guys always look great.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Yes.
Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a real sister?
Hi.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Its not over yet.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
I am. Ben Meeker.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Why?
Its true, Sheriff.
This is starting to spook me.
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
He can still watch.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
You locked yourself in.
I don't want to.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
Exactly what do you need?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Who is it?
Yes.
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
If you say so.
It's French, though.  It really is.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
You're Holly.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Could you--
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
What are you doing here?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Oh.
Yeah.
Elliot!  Don't!
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Great idea.
I know.
Where're you going?
Are you in a bad mood?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you angry with me?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Get his wine away.
I am... I did slave all day.
Yeah.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So?
Mmm...
What's the problem?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Who is it?
Oh...
Like what?!  What?
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
It was on your shirt!
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I think so.
I want to experience childbirth.
Okay, okay.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Well, how about this?
Oooo.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Uh-huh.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Oh, gosh.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Well--
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Can we, can we go?
No!
Thanks for a swell time.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Yes, you do recall, right?
Yeah.
Nobody ever said it.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Hi.
Mmm, what?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Hi.
...read it over, and think about it.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
It wasn't my day.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Say it in English.
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Rich, comic book freaks.
I'm not.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
How you doin?
...sir...?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
No.  And...
What would <u>that</u> be?
He is...?
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
Yes, I did.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
What is that supposed to mean...?
That could be.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
You nervous...?
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Is it necessary to know?
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
What's that, Baby?
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
...and that is what you need to expand.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
....because we don't have any mmm...
What shape is the scar?
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Tell me why...?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Talia, don't go!
Freeze!  You're busted!
What are you gonna do about it?
No, they're not from Wendy.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know                         ] you like to think of yourself as                            ] the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're                            ] getting just as spooky.

Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
What else don't you believe in?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Because you're an idiot.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
No.
What are you doing?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Probably....
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Do you take German?
Did you miss him completely?
We killed them, didn't we?
Did not.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
The bomb, asshole!
Cool off, we're seniors.
Turn that back on!
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
is very angry.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Hello!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
To be known as He!
That.
I shall call him Diello.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Poor Father . . .
I'm coming with you.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Of course, yes.
It's inside a moving car.
Skin cancer.
No.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Since what?
What?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I've been in here before.
I said she's been missing for-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
What?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
What do you want?!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
What's under that sheet...?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Vietnam!
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
What's the matter?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
You test each one thoroughly?
Hey, c'mon.
So where are all your toys?
Are you being helped, sir?
Any particular brand?
How's the new place?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Oh, great.
Isn't that always the way?
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
About us.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
How long does it have to be a new house?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
He wants to see me!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
It's fun.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
When did you get back?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
No.  I don't scare easy.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
How long is the voyage?
Yes.
That doesn't matter.
Different places.
I cannot stay.
Why?
Do you love me, Conner?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
I remember you.
I'll be fine.
Then who's Russell Nash?
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
No.
So?
--for three hundred years.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
No.
Why?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jen?  Are you all right?
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
I have to tell you something --
It's over.  We have to give up.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
Talley?
I'll give you these people.
What?
That you, Talley?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Give up.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
We can take it with us.
It won't be a problem.
Give me an ETA.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Are civilians inside?
What are we going to do about Mike?
Smith!  Wake up!
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Is something wrong with Jane?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Let it go, Captain.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
How about you and your sister?
We're okay.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Please, I don't use guns.
You want to pay me?
How many in your family?
Ten.
Give me it.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
You said you had no whiskey.
What do you mean, General?
When?
We are better here.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Satellite feed.
Mr. Manager.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Call, sir?
What do you want?
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Oh, my God!
Paul, don't let them die.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Go to the roof now.
Tell me what it was.
A car.
What does it matter.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Let me go. Children get off.
What sort of plan?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
That is why they call it coach?
What do we do with all these people?
Why the hurry, Roger?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Oh dear.
There must be some other way out.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
-- what was he doing here?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
What?
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Why?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
I was upstairs with Eddie --
That's crazy!
What?
Then who are they?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
-- the sadistic prick --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Do something!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
House 2, Guests 0.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Well, I don't.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Rewind that.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
We don't have proof of that.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It looks delicious...
Where does this amulet come from?
By killing them?
Well then who did?!
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
Why?
Mommy!
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Are you playing tricks on me?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
I think everything's ready.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Maura, what is this!
Maura!
We don't know.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
What's going to happen?
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Not on station time.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Hmmmm.....
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
You got about five minutes and change.
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Anna, I think you better stay....
How.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
And I'll bring my entourage...
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
I hope you know what....
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Employer?  The president?
Sharp.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Hungry, anyway.
What a horrible little person.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
You mean you know about this?
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Tell me about it.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Well, I --
...Why, this is worthless.
Awwww, buddy --
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...Yeah, go ahead.
No, sir.
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Maybe he's wise.
She's good, Bennie.
Thank you for waking me.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
I'd love to.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Mrs. Rand.
But you didn't have to come up here.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Mr. Holland?
It's my day off.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I often do.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
That shirt?
The turkey in?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
See for yourself.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Anyone special? You know...
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Here.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Dad stop it!
Nah.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Talking to me, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
Hi mom.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Flame on, asshole.
No candy for me?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Did you tell Sandy?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
I don't know.
You're parents at that party?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
With who?
It feels warm.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
Nice kid.
So far.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Duggar called him?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
No.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Your friend's all business.
What is it?
The other guy?
I was her best friend.
Since grade school.
You want me to take you somewhere?
What was it?
Thought you might find that.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
Ah! You have questions?
That is a picture, nothing more.
No, my beloved, my child.
Then blame the one who made her...
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
No.
Your melancholy eyes...
More.
I'm not your daughter.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Yes.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
This is monstrous!
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
What do you want from me?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You're sure?
The crucifix -
Dear God, what have I done?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
And if I don't?
Have you ever been caught?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
NO!!!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
That's all past, Lestat.
You can't look at them...
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
I want off this island.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
That could break the machine.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I'm the King of the World.
Karla! You promised.
You get any sleep at all?
Karla!
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Voodoo.
Don't kill me --
What?
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Pretty cool bar.
Why? He can't help us.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
What's going on?
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
That your father and I ——
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
But the war, the army —— they need you.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
But they're somebody's children.
All right –– all right.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Yes, George?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Who is it?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hey, Ernie!
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Uh-huh.
Nice girl, Mary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Aw, get going!
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Oh, it's wonderful.
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Hey, George . . .
George, can I see you for a second?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
All of it?
Those Rockefellers!
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Made up your mind yet?
Neither am I.
Well, why don't you say it?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Have you made up your mind?
About what?
When did you get back?
Where'd you get that dress?
Do you like it?
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Mary! Mary!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
You forgot something.
Don't!
Yeah.
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Loser sails home alone.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
In here.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Pop....
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Sean's still out there.
May I have this dance?
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
We don't know that, do we?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Late.
Fooling around?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Where's my day book?
For me?
Careful.  What's wrong?
What?
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
What're you going to do today?
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Where the hell is Air One?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Hang on!
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
Come on back up here!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Mmmmmm.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Until we find something.
Power line.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You always go with Andy.
Eat Cheerios.
Be reasonable, please....
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
You called, Doctor?
I don't like what he does.
Not enough loving.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
It's romantic down here.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
You're going down there again?
Yes.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
... Mean through the tubes?
No,  I'm not going through there.
It's too soon to move him.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I told you, something's upset them.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Afraid I can't do that.
I like it when they wake up.
Believe me, I am.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
Sure.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Yeah, from Boston.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Yes, it's great!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
What the hell's there?
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
Look great, don't I?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Thea....
Where are you going?
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Henny Youngman....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Yes!
I'll be in to read you a story.
Sit down, Ma....
What?
You could teach...You could....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You look tired....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Promise me you'll be all right....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
You're impossible....
I have two right feet.
I'm sorry...I....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
I'm going down, Jake....
It'll work....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
That bad, huh?
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Is it your vehicle?
What about that kid, Ross?
Yeah, he can go ...
How's the new residence?
No, you didn't.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
You don't really believe this?
What if we need a back up?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
That's bullshit,
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Did he get you the job?
Vehicle references.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Me?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
You do?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Could you just stop moving?
No.
Oh Jerry.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
That took guts.
We will be fine!
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Yeah, what happened there.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't like to give up.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
I heard.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Yes.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Call me tomorrow.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I'm a little worried --
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm sorry I asked.
Beautiful.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You'll lose.
Jerry --
No.
Hi.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
That's him. That’s Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
He loves you too.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We need to keep moving.
NO!
He used to know me.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
Why?
But then you never get to go in space.
Hmmm.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
I have never been on this island!
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
You hear something?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Resentful.
What?
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
My vacation is over in a week.
Where does it say that?
What are you guys gonna do?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
What is that?
We took to the rock.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Something's wrong.
What's that?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Ian.  It's guano.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Oh, shit.
- - a gizzard - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Are you sure?
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Do you see anything?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Yeah.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
What kind of opinions?
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Ah - - they're here.
What's that?
Your silence intrigues me.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Thanks for the presents.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
Chain saws.
Yeah?
He... he's here...
Sorry.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You work in the insurance department?
-- In magazines nobody reads.
A man must eat --  And drink.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's what I'm paid to do.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
In a small way.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
What of it?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
They're not obliged to tell.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
No, I suppose not.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
There's a light up ahead.
Give it back!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
They' re dead.
Native costume?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you gonna start it up?
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I'd just be guessing.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Oh no, I don't think --
You said that.
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
Well do you think it was him?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Thanks.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
Please.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Right back at the start, right?
I called Trina.
Mm.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Well as a matter of --
Someone's been doing all these things.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
All right.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
What else do you know?
Are you closing the case?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
What about my orange juice?
What if she forgets?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad...
Is this really your desk?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Are you going to get remarried?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
What did you do when you were little?
Your mom.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Sustained.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Did you wish to?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Yes...
Somewhere in between.
I...I don't know...
Yes.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
I've seen him.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
And?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
I lost him?  I lost him?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Any prospects?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Look, Ted, all I--
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Things? What kind of things?
What are you going to do?
You're sure?
California?
What d'you tell her?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Hey, that's terrific.
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, what are you talking about?!
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Will we be in this war?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Does he have the spot?
What do you think?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
No, Holiness.
I will miss you.
We have.
You are unharmed?
You're a beautiful woman.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
And what would he do come winter?
We are here on official business.
Cocktail?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where is he?!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
No way.
You ready on shore?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
I never had sex with you!
<u>Jack</u>!
Eh.  Fuck it.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Baby crocs?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Alright, Jack!
He's mooing.
It was... something meeting you.
We set?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Seconds.  Three, four.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What was that?
Hank!
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
<u>Kelly</u>--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
What'd I do?
No. He won't come after me.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Maybe they'll catch up.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Killed outright?
He kills w-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
I heard a strange sound...
You know I can't make that promise.
What...?
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
My God, you've grown up.
We leave in the morning?!
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Will you consider that?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
How long?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Webb's at Edward?
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
What is enough?
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
The honors of war?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Qui vive?
La victoire.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Jesus Christ...
Your suit, Becky!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Where's Doc?!
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
If he had his blinkers on--
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What is it?
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Well?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
I thought this was a pub.
Like antiques.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
JD.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
All right, Dad.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
That's it all done, we are off.
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
You will what?
You know how much it is, Nick.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
What's left over?'
The money, the gear!
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
You think I can't learn that?
That isn't true.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
I'm feeling okay--
How's business?
That the word on our boy?
That badge--
So is Buddy on your short list?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
That's not the point.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
I'm a colonel.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
I got a pretty good guess.
PDA?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Didn't have a father?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
It's a .45.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Right.
And people make their choice--
Why would you want to do that?
Reputation?
Protection?
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
I thought you were married!
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
Besides my father, I mean.
Sam--
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Right. When he was killed.
I never said that.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
How come?
It was for personal consumption.
Murdered him?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Nice-looking kid.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
How come it feels the same?
What was your father's name?
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I'm going over to the other side.
You don't need to cuff me.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
You going to tell her?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
About?
Don't.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
What's the connection?
When do you want me to start?
So why did you marry him?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
It's okay.
What was that?
...yes?
Is it finished?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
Are you finished with me?
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I want to see Swann face to face.
D'Amour --
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Does anybody?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Is that all?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
A couple of weeks.
And he's dead?
Swann?  What are you doing?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Ok.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
Charlotte, who?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
It's bad isn't it?
Tomorrow.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Yes?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Bob?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Do you want to- 
Hello?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Evelyn Waugh?
Why do you have to defend her?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
You smell weird.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh, the record company sent these...
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I can't believe Will killed him.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Claire...
I found them in your file box.
What a...jerk!
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Seemed...on edge.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You'll do it?
What is it?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Get up!!
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Good seeing you again.
You know what?  You can go.
There weren't any voices.
He could see me.
Thanks again for everything.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Where is she now?
nothing.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
That's not it.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Thanks.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
Can I take your coat?
Sort of.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Nah.
No.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No one's forcing her.
I found you someone.
And he's fine, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
It's okay, little baby.
What are we playing for?
Clothes.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Who's nobody?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
What the hell's going on?
Cheap date.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least you got your priorities straight.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
What?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You're serious.
Maybe go back to school.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Hey, girl.
Zeke.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
We were just studying.
How was your game?
Why not?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Well what's the situation?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
Yeah.
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's not -- what's a 422?
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
I'm sorry.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Please, yes.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
ok.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
Well.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
I lost my gun.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
I want a shot of tequila too.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Can you hold it?
-- no.
Did you listen to me?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
That's right.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
I've been a good worker --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
You do?
No.
She loves you.
...cocksucker....
Go fuck myself?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
-- just to clarify --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Where are you from originally?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
They wouldn't?
Are you asking me a question?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No I Said.
I preffer to stand.
I didn't do anything.
Been drinkin' today?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
How you doing?
Who?
No one else that I know?
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
...say it, Jimmy...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Yes you do.
Hello?
I'm Bob.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
They look pretty smart, I think.
Are you on drugs right now?
What does that mean?
Linda --
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Be ready at two --
I didn't know the answer --
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
It's not right.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Mother -- ?
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
What do you propose to do?
What is that?
Three days.
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
We must stop him!
So what has changed?
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
No, not Louis!
But why?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
What is that?
How did you know -- ?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Who came?
Betrothed?  I think not.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
You dead yet?
What number did you tear out?
What number, on the first page?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Every step of the way.
What do you think?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Let's roll -
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Where is he?!!
Yeah?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I had it all on tape...
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Long gone, huh?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
How long do I have?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Is it weird?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Wait, Will...
That's narrow?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Have him peel the top label back.
Not yet.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Tonic will be fine.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
I have work to do at the plant.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Me.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I don't want to know.
Do you see?
God, no.
No.
She'll be in, in the morning...
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Why do you think I called?
He's very strong physically.
What happened to them?
No.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
What did he want?
We have it good, don't we?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
I remember.
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
Mama was probably asleep.
I want to see you, too.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Will it keep them out?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
How?
Did the girl die?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
I thought you would have some ideas.
Yes.
Yes.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I haven't decided yet.
You got it.
People love... comedians.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
I'm sorry, George...
They're having a laugh...
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
What do you mean?
No thanks.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Have you told your family?
You're not listening to me --
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Hey Andy, good show.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I was very original!
Goals are important.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
That was a really hot house!
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Sure...
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
We'll need a search running.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
You got the money?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Do you?
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Hello?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Why not?
What truth?
When?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
And you still believe I'm the One?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Who?
My name is Trinity.
What?
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
That's different.
Are you worried?
Did you go to her?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, you're not.
Are you all right?
Where is it?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
Neo!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Can't we come with you?
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Jewish...
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
Hey...you got nothing here.
How?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Shut up!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't you move!!!
What pipes?
Hey, shut up.
$20.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Teresa.
Nothing.
Please take it.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
What's the matter with this kid?
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Just keep him quiet.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
That was 'Joe'.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
I know you do, darling.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Who's Annie?
It's for the party, Dad --
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
I wasn't going to say --
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
What about the Mayor?
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
I thought you were buying my company.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
And what would that be?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Did you just hear something?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
Yeah, something he goes by --
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
'Just kidding'?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Whose?
Yours.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
That's it?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Thanks, Quince.
Yeah.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He said that?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not time yet.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Didn't the family get together last night --?
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Love.
You love Allison, don't you?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Very well, I'll watch.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
To bed.
And is your heart beating strangely?
I loved it.
Where are you going?
I like you in a black tie.
Well -- I --
How are you?  How're you feeling?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Of course.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I guess...
Hello, Bill.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't like what you're saying.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You are --?
'Yes' what?
Where are you?  Are you there?
I think you know --
I'm sorry --
Hi, Bill --
How're you doing--?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Next week?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Drew told me.
Aw, you're tough.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
...We know so little about each other.
78.
Should I wear it?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
How long have I been here?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Don't say anything else.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Is that what your little note says?
You know him?
Yes.
How do I know he did that to you?
His name was Jimmy.
Who?
Yeah, I hated it.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.
Did you?
What happened?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Calm down.
Don't say another fucking word!
They're not looking for him.
Well, that's me.
How do you know about me?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Things change.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Natalie? Natalie who?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Who the fuck are you?
Like what?
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
Lemon or lime?
Doing...?
I was the kids' godfather.
They'll kill Gina.
We're not certain...
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
Tell them what you want.
Sure.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Were you born in Havana?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Where would I go?
Is this the protective male talk?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
You afraid of violence?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Yeah?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
I am asking.  You to me.
Then you should.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Yeah.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Oh, good...
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Okay...see you soon.
You mean with the flowers...?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
The Statue of Liberty.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
For what?
For money for what?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
You don't seem like no fag...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Hell, don't cry about it!
What?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
The kids? Why are they...
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
I'll pay extra
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Girlfriend?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
What do you mean?
What?  You gotta be joking.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
What?
Whose?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
My passport!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
His name?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Wait a minute-
You feel anything?
The kid...
The kid's with them!!
My God, what the hell are you...?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
Which way?
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
I heard how you talked to him.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
What-
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What?
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
My daughter must be going nuts.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
I'm...
You want me to burn my book?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
The what?
What about a bee...?
A toast?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Why would you lose me?
What?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Just leave it, all right?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Great.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
How grateful?
Well that depends.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
We're due to take off.
There she is.  I got visual.
And the check's in the mall.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- right..where is it?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
And six billion in the world.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Before you are.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
What did you think you were doing!
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
It's the transponder.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Roger that.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Come on!
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
What kind of show.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
Kittridge...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
It's quite out of the question.
Mm - Hmmm...
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Jack.  Jack.
The package is in the open.
I'm willing to take the chance.
What problem?
How was Chicago?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Iíve got a shadow.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
The Shawfish?
Yes.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You're not sleepy?
Here.  Ti amo. 
Johnny Cammareri.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Mona?
And what did they say?
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
Yes.
Why?
Yes. Do you want...
Maybe I should come back another time.
Loretta. What's that smell?
Why what?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
What are you doing!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
A bride without a head!
Oh my God.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What's the matter?
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
Why?
Let me go home.
He's coming.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
I got things to do.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
I shouldn't.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't understand.
How near is she to death?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
You have a brother?
What?
Will you live here?
How's the mother?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
It's late.
Johnny...
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Sorry. That was rude.
What do you do?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Then why are you eating alone?
May I walk with you a ways?
Oh.
You were a tiger last night.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Oh!
NI!   NI!
All right!  What do you want?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
None shall pass.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Look!
Come Here.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Bedevere, my Liege.
By what name are you known?
What?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
I'm thirty-seven.
Well ... I AM king.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
What is your quest?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your quest?
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
I can't.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
How?
The Castle Anthrax?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Well, she's got a point.
I don't think I was.
No.  It's unhealthy.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
They're all saying the word ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
No, no, no.
So?
Sixty.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Convey her a message.
Whom you address.
It's so infernally cold in here.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Checked and locked, sir.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
There are important papers from --
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
What brings you here?
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Was there never ambition?
Aye, ma'am.
Who by?
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
Is that not enough?
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Mrs Brown.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
How long has he been this sick?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Your Majesty --
Does that thing work?
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Happy?
So how did it know my name, then?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
No way.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
Dante's Inferno.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I'm going home Cynthia.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
No problem. What's on your mind?
Whatever.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
A car ... a car accident.
No, no, I'm fine.
What?
You're still here?
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't know who I am.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
You don't remember anything else?
No. Just the coffee.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
What's  the matter now?
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Not a coke or anything?
No.  I haven't seen any.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Leave him, he's dead.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
I'm listening.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
What was that ?
What are you DOING here ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
That's not to tough.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He probably has a history of this shit.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Sir ?
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
What did you hear ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
No I am not.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
THANK YOU.
What do you remember about her.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Do what?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Oh.  Ohhh?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Sure am, who are you?
More than anything in the world.
But I wanna write about her.
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Vada?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
MOM!
What difference does it make?
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You would.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Come and get it.
Uh oh...
It's dangerous!!
Right.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Yeah?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Muh??
No problem.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Committed.
Maybe.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
You know how I feel about you.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Yes, I do.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
You couldn't?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
They're enormous, I know.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
You're such a baby.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
It's there.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Home sweet home.
What happened to her?
Yes.
Well, you were pretty great!
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I love this guy! 
Goodnight Vada.
I found this.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
I'm very nervous.
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
He won't give it to me.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
Sure.
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Uh huh.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
It'll bleed.
You have no personality.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Woah!!
Hi Vada.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I do, she's real funny.
No, I'm hiding out.
I dunno..
Close your eyes.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
You don't miss much.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Someday she'll thank you.
Ben Gay.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
I was gonna predict that.
But he always says...
Exactly.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I think he's been fired.
W...
Quite the little eccentric.
You're not eating.
Where did we first hear th...
No accents today.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
And your point?
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
And to m...
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What's wrong honey.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
What?
What!
What's he running for?
He's my father.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Hi, Sherry.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
No.
Nashville.
I feel really good.
I don't think so.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
And before?
No, I don't.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Who is this?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
How old are you?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yea.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
What time?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Sleeping.
How's your stomach?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Come on.
I'm Opal.
Pleasure
Where are you from?
Who?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
Oh, why thank you.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
You've heard of it?
Say something.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Yours.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
How 'bout Manson?
She sings? What does she sing?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Tell me about the purity.
I'm sure we will.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
No. Not really.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
You can't be serious?
Roger?
Rollin'...and speed!
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Is that her real name?
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Two guys?
And me.
They done that too long in my family.
No thanks.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Where's Wilma?
How 'you doing?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
You working?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
What d'you mean?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
My kids want me to teach them.
You heard me!
I don't think that'll happen.
A whole lot, Frankie.
That's right.
'You Will Anderson?
What happened?
No.
I heard you.
No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!
She don't look no worse to me.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
How 'you gonna live?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I'm still on my honeymoon.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Ghost a steppin' razor...
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
What about McCoy?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
The words?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Right...
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
It'll flatline your ass.
Yo.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
What about the route to the core?
Wait... You hear that?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Why would you want me to kill you?
What's my end?
What is it?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
How long have I been out?
You okay?
I'll be okay.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Something exotic I hope.
He projects with neural implants.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Like what?
What?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Yeah, I know.
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
How about this?
Anita!
Hi!
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Wow. It's packed.
Transitioned?
Do I want to be crunched?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
God, I can't do this.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Yoooooow.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Just what?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Oh, come on Dad...
It's not the gas, Dad!
What are you talking about?
Come back here!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
I'm sorry...
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
I figured you might like some help.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What's all this.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Here.
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
What's so funny?
Huh?
So, school going alright?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
What's that?
I'll need to take her things.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Mom?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Watching TV.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Do you still...see each other?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You like gymnastics?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
That was different.
Freddy?
Are you okay?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What?
Max, where's Kristen?
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Oh God.
I'm serious.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
Then maybe you're ready.
Try me.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
A sad choice.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Lovely to meet you.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Okay.
I thought you were leaving.
Whoopsidaisies.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
This is the place.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
With a goat playing a violin.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
This is certainly... ah...
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Miracles do happen.
Anna Scott?
Yes.
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Do you want to stay?
Hello, Bernie.
Is this your first film?
Da Vinci?
What happened?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Ahm... room service.
Well, fire away.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
That's not fair.
Oh God no.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
No, no.  She doesn't.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
No, 'fraid not.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Yes.
Spike!
Why not?
What's going on?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
So?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Sorry to have bothered you.
Oh, I had them removed.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
O-o-o-oh...
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
So long, kid.
A bus?
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
In ya go...
M-M-M-Mack?
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Let me get on your shoulders.
It's the questions she asks.
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Lobotomy!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
So why are you talking to him?
No!
Hear what?
Yeah, it's cold!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
I see...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
When?
'Kay, Mac!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
You know, I never got your name.
No...
He's a patient, Rose...
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Why, sure, ma'am...
At this hour?
What's that?
Were they pen pals?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
What?
I'm a liberal!
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Who's this?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
My name's 
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
NO.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
What?
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
You aren't?
Hello.
Wait.
What looks good?
So what do you think?
Oh, hello.
Scientologist.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Now what do we do?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I'm hungry.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
I never even got to be single.
He's heeeeeerrre...
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
I think it's time we got some professional help.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
And he is living proof.
How old are you?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
She what?!
Well, where are they?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Then don't.
That's right... .
Mm—hmm.
Boss loader!
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
I don't know.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
Pigeons... .
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
Terry— what's happening to you?
Told him what?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
Edie...
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't want to hear it in there.
Good luck.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Better.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
You do?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Well?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Then cancel my order.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
Is there time?
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
You didn't visit him in prison.
You did work for Emil, right?
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
You find out?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
What'd you talk about?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
I could walk out of here.
Why you think is today?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
You know how to use one a these?
You comfy?
If I could have a little more room.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Unless you wanna tell me.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
What were you gonna do with me?
You were going to see her?
So she did help you?
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You're not dumb.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
When?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
I'm not leaving Midge.
For a time.
There were others.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Take the next exit.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
It's a guy you know.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Me?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You're not my type.
He said he stayed here last November.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Dad...
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
Not at all.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Do you always stutter?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That's me, Sir.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
I didn't mean it.
Fuck you.
Get me into a plane!
Land of the free.
Fun today.  Like old times.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Win?
What's your name?
Oh, this is Betty.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
Brilliant, Admiral.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Do you believe in all of that?
Carol!
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
And we're here on the couch...
Would you?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
What would that be, sir?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
I wish she hadn't.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
What're you doing here anyway?
Don't you get along with your parents?
For everyone.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
It's Charlie!
Young lady, you're drunk!
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
The hat business is in trouble.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Would you get that, dear?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
But accidents can happen.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Richard, take it easy.
Wbat're you talking about?
Hi, Richard.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
I think so.
What's his name?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
How long have you been here?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
Jesus.
Bob...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
You're going to the office?!
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
One hour!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Thanks for coming in.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
Innocuous?
One week old.
Nine.
Continue.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Who'd you get?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
Sure. It's fine.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Yes.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Yes.
Is that a question?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Leave that.
Why are we going to do that?
Get real.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Second.
Who?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Fine, Joe.
Don't know, Joe.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Now that you mention it...
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
You taught him a lesson.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
Don't wanna miss this.
What? What is it?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Had it with deals.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Just give me your hand.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
What?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
What, you're goin' off, too?
Why did I fall on you?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
I don't suppose....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
New Mecca....
"God is Great," yes?
Very big beads.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Look -- she remembers.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
How did it go?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
What happened?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
What is it?
Why special?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
One is in a museum!
Sustained.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
What about it?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Are you going to take her with you?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
It's humiliating.
Would you like to come along?
Bunker...
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
How the hell did he get away?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah?
But what'd she actually do?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
What are the heads?
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
...there's nobody.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Right on.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Vancouver, B.C.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
I think I'd like to dance.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
You're drinking it.
I don't.
You tried to run away.
Quarter after one. Why?
Certainly not to me.
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
They know you here--know your name.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Why?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Do you have to leave the note?
Frozen.
No.  I paid him off.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Ale. I don't mind.
That's an evasion and you know it.
What this?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
You understand perfectly.
They call me Jeff.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Private eye?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
What'll you have, Margo?
Sometimes.
Who told you my name?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Passkey?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Got a moment, Inspector?
What do I get for it?
Open it and count it.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
I think so.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Pretty big chance, huh?
No suicide.
May you what?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
He checks too.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
What'll we do about it, Margo?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
I will, thanks.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
How's Mary?
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
How nice.
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen much of you.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Let me see.
Let me see.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Dad.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
No.
She said that?
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Talk.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
A little mushy.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Aw shit.
I know where they're going.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
You're wastin' your time.
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Any sign of the hostages?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Mmmnnn...?
Your uncle will like this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Who are you going after next, sir?
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sit... and spin.
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
What's your name, lover.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
All right.  How much for the week?
Three.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Did you buy some clothes?
This isn't a date.
Any good?
I'm sorry.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Vivian...
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What's that?
Huh?
But don't they have it in English?
I know.  I'm glad.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
My what?
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Yes...
Vivian's in sales.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Why?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
'Lo.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Oooh, I love those.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
You'll like it fine.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Do you remember me?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
You're a silly girl.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Brides often are, I'm told.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Why should that make such a difference?
I thought I was going faster.
Hello.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Inigo.
A book?
Yes.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Could this be a trap?
And our assets?
-- all that I have and more please --
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Because I know something you don't know.
You're amazing!
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
-- get back, witch --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
An hour.
Guess what.
Congratulations.
"By the light, by the light,
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
What???
I'm not going to jump on you!
Where would you like to eat?
What kind now, Leo?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Max, I...
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
The Graf Spee...
People can hear you.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
How early?
No one met her?
Or arrived with her.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Cash.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Why?
I don't know.
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Of course not. Please.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Like what?
Please!
What difference does that...
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Yes.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Just wait here?
Sam.
Without calling me?
Who's he?
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
You going to wait here for me?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
It's regular. Okay?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I can come down next week.
No.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Uncommon, too.
You go out... with friends?
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
May I see your license?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
My mother is not dead!
I don't know what you've been saying.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Just before she died she came to--
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Well, news of Buckley?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
The wound is bleeding!
That spoke to you?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
But it was really my fault.
Are you giving me this straight?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
It happens that I'm the law.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Which one is me? The horse?
I am right! I know I'm right!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Cry-baby?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
You weren't going with her?
Heaven knows. A lot.
What is it? What happened?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Yep. Everything settled.
You did.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Dysfunctional --
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
In what sense were they bad?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Five hundred rabbits?
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well... maybe...
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
What'd I say?
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches!
No you can't.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
They... they shot me.
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
What's mine say?
You live like a pig.
Our resignations.
Maybe.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know... you could say thank you.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Been waiting long?
Come again... ?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
This shit was Ming.
They're... around.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Yoda spoke of another.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Someone who loves you.
Lower it!
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Ugh!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Yes. It's you Leia.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Yoda, I must know.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Janet.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Oh Brad.
You did right.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Like I'm outside in the rain
...How's the turtle food this week?
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
I sold them to you.
Yes, I do.
It's only temporary.
Would ya take off your glasses?
...T-thank you.
Do me another favor?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Paulie!
...Paulie. Stop now!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
...Still don't feel no heat.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Of wa?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Few minutes?
Seven minutes!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
What's ya name again?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
I said, how ya feelin'?
The legs must be goin'.
Rice is a bum.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
How you holdin' up, kid?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
It don't bother me none.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Whatta you think?
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
To see ya train.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Yeah?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Pink for flower.
Nurse.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
What in bloody hell is going on?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Do I need to repeat myself?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
I didn't say I was.
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
I take it you still want the money...
I swear...
There is one other thing...
Really?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
And you respect him.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
They call me Swede.
I ride with fat-boy...
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
You were behind the door?
Right now?
So I do it.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
And now...
What of it?
What's the story?
You slept with her!
I'm alright.  And you?
Can you get it?
Ten thousand right here.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
I've got one condition.
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
What's wrong?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I don't believe it.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Sure.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Is that the mail?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
And what happened?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
This isn't right...
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Those girls drove off because of you.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
I'm sorry.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
What are you doing?
It's my job!
Who?
Good at what?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
What's she doing?
Well we're not friends.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
No.
Mind your own business.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
End of the line.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Dancing?
No.  I'm going to find out.
What?!?!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
This money is evidence.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
And that, of course, would be me.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
No.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
The license!  You get it?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
They put you in charge?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Jesus...what do you want?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Any demands yet?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Where do we find him?
Ambassador Han.
My daughter.
It's Griffin.
I would like one of my people to help.
He is very good.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
We do it to our dog.
It's hurting.
Rub your ears.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Then come for dinner.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
That's fair.
Give me that!
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Excuse me?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
It's probably because you got him fired.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
A harmless joke.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
No.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hate boats.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
I'll wait.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Does it have wheat in it?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
You couldn't.
It was my mother's.
-- it was a betrayal.
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Becky?
Is this crazy?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
I love the symphony.
No, I know that part --
A sense of humor.
I want my money.
Please --
Destiny takes a hand.
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
All righ...
It's been about a year and a half.
Have you had any relationship since?
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Yeah.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
No.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Dad --
What is it?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Dad?  About last night?
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
What do you think?
I'm starting to forget her.
It's a sign.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Did not.
Did too.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
What about camping?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
You could have called me --
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
A meeting?
Sun up.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Will you be still?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You mean Delaware?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Nothing.
Why don't you call the cops?
Oh. Hi.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Like you?
What's wrong, Danny?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Can you set that up?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Yes, Jimmy.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Crank or glass?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
What the hell is this?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
No last name?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
The Mexicali Boys
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
We're in business.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
No kiddin'?
Where?
In the shadow by those two trees.
Not yet.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Good luck, Captain.
The men said, nine.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
But, sir...
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Uh, Captain...
Maybe.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Three for three.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
And what about your own hand?
I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Here they come.
Goddamn it!
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Because he's guilty.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Then what's love?
C'mon Lloyd.
So, what's your point?
No, you're not a guy.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You're going.
Do you love him?
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
I swear to god.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Hello.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Thank you very much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
What's wrong?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
No, no.
Then don't do it.
Okay.
How's it going?
It's your castle, man.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know this part, keep reading.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
You know Diane Court?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
Well, let's find him.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
In Breslau.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
What's going on?
You asked for shoe polish.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
What are you doing?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
And killing.
I didn't do enough.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
I can do it, Captain.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
I'm inquisitive.
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
It’s over, Cotton.
Fair enough.
And much richer as a result.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
But you’ll never get away with it.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
What guy?
He seemed harmless.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Yeah?
Not good. How you doin?
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
They're roomates.
Don't worry...
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Sid, I'll come with you.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Don't do this.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
How many guys they have on you?
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
I hate scary movies.
I'll be right back.
Jesus.  Hello?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
To see your reaction.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Who?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Are you sure?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
They found another note?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Do you want us to come with you?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
I am Gale Weathers!
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Yeah.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Let's get out of here!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Yeah?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Dude. What are you doing here?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Ready?
Yes, sir.
My dad's in the other room.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Jesus, SHIT!
No...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I don't understand...
What number is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Hello.
Uh-huh.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
...please...
Come on, yes you do.
Michael... Michael Myers.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
You owe my mother.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
I heard screaming.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
We had a run in the mass murder section.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
He came to make up.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
You've left unfinished business before.
Have you heard?
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
What are you talking about?
How you feeling?
What do you mean?
You didn't know.
You should be thanking me.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Not here.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Is there any blood in it?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
I know.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
There must be something.
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
I wish I still thought like you.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
That is.
I'm fine.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Stay with him.
Wait!
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Crime of passion.
Did their son see it happen?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
Another one, eh?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
That don't make 'em kin...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
You ask her!
Ethan, quit it!
Lemme alone...
They'll be back...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
You crazy?
Stop that!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
What are you doing?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Who's that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
I really hate to bother him, but...
I've killed my husband!
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Ah
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
You have the last act?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Most interesting.
How long has it been?
No, your marriage bed.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No Juliet?!
I did not.
What do we do now?
How will it?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
What is the story?
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Verona again.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
You have opened the playhouses?
Oh my lady, my love!
Can you love a fool?
I am.
You never spoke so well of him.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Your name?
Take off your hat.
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
A theatre poet?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I was trying to educate you.
You mean immoral.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
I won't be able to.
Don't you worry about that.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
You're not eating.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
So I gathered.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
No. Why should it?
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
Aroused and inflamed.
What I am.
Yeah.
No.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
I don't want to. It's different.
That's not him.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He can't stay up there.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
David?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
You mustn't take it so badly.
What?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Of course.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Two hundred.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
What do we do here, David?
In this firm.
I'm boring?
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
I see.
No.
Writing seems easy.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
It was some guy called Brian.
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Offering it for debate.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
That you were just indulging me.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Lester.
What?
I'll be back in a while.
George --
You're looking great, baby.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Want me to?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Shit.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
... yeah.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I am not!
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
Buffums?
I don't know. Probably not.
Where do you want to do this?
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
... I don't get it done often.
No.
And?
And what?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- this guy with Jill.
-- we can't now.
I don't know what gets into me.
Where do you want to go?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Where are you going?
It's too late...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
No, man.
-- White ladies?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
Hi, George.
There were some shots.
Well, like what?
Keep moving --
What?
Will we live together?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Yeah, baby.
About what?
Your advice!
What business meeting?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Ha, ha.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
That was him.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
How many?
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
You live like a pig.
Did they have something against me?
Want a drink?
No thanks.
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
No.
I'll call you back...
I'm coming over.
Okay.

Sid.
Yes.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie Shawn.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Nothing.
I'm exaggerating.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What did you do?
I don't think so.
-- why?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Thank you.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No.
Everything okay, son?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I'm hungry.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Dad?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Who's Tony?
Okay, Mom.
Jack...
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Mom?
Oh,
To my stomach.
How did he manage to do that?
Sure.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
No.
How?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Perfect for a child.
Any ideas yet?
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Somebody did that to him.
Give me the bat.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
five months of peace is just what I want.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Royalty?
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
You booger.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
No.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Sure.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SPIRIT
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
What did who say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You bastard!
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Oh my! 
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
St. Anne's?
You were unhappy?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Sometimes it's not enough!
So... hi there.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
A vote?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
He's a businessman.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I am?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
We didn't tell you what?
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Many have.
Who took the meat?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
What are you spying on?
He is a behemoth.
... Brom Bones...
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Hmm?  See them?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Listen to what you say....
No, I couldn't...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
What good is this?
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
What can we do?
What now?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
I insist that you have it.
People have put their trust in you.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Yes, actually.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
No.
Yeah, they's good all right.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
How are you, Bill?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
It's too big.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You like that Vaughan?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They still around, your folks?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Were they bad people?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
What you readin'?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Is that right?
You will? For sure?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I want to come back and stay here.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Yes sir.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Why?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I didn't know you took pictures.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
What do you mean?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Not a peep.
She probably died.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Five thousand bucks.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
So I can get my job back.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
I shouldn't have let him go.
I figured he had a right to know.
And?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
So what's the time?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
What time is it?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
That's it. In a nutshell.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
How do you want that cooked?
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
I don't know.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We don't let go, you s...
What for, Sheriff?
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Obviously.
Is it possible?
Sure, anything's poss...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
What are you doing?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
But this is so humiliating.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Like right after the ceremony.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Shut up and keep packing.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Terribly sorry.
Good night, Sugar.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Thirty-four.
What's the big idea?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
We can have it altered.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
It doesn't matter.
We'll adopt some.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Running away?  From what?
Rough?
I'll say.
Bingo?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Yeah.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
What's happened?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
You're society girls?
- Inauguration balls -
Tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Have you tried?
That makes me feel just awful.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Would you do me a favor?
I think you're on the right track.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
PLEASE!
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
I cut myself shaving.
You and who else?
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Why, with you.
Huh?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Mmm.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
You quitting?
A weekend?
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
What?!
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
You have had girlfriends?
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Uh huh...
That does it...
And you say all them people is dead now?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Nothin'...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Where's everybody?
What's in there, David!?
Any sign of Sounder?
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Yes, mam...
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
What is this?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Hey Cartman.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Goodnight, honey.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
What was that word, young man!?
Who are you, kid?
Purpre mama!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Shiteater-
What about air strikes?
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
No, it was worse than that...
What is Terrance and Phillip?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
NAZIS!!
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
So...
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
I don't know what we're facing.
Sure.
Sooner than later.
Will you marry me?
Where's Taylor?
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
The pin machine?
Yeah, basement bingo.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Sure, Sid.
What's on your mind, Miles?
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
We ain't married no more.
Hello, mom?
Buzz Fazeli.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
I like the sport the way it is.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Not while I'm in training.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I could let them go for ten.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
How do you get this thing down?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I am a professional man.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Fletcher, get away from there...
I can't see...
Direction's east coming!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Thirty yards.
Don't do it!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
It's impossible.
Picked up something?  What is it?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
Damn it, Edmunds?
Going active.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Any sign of Harry?
Well, where the fuck is he?
It's chipped.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
How can he be missing?
That's quite a secret.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
We have a library?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Yeah, why?
What are they?
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Don't tell me to calm down!
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
I would.  But my suit --
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You don't believe me.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
He translated it wrong.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
But how?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's a soporific.
It's like a sleeping pill?
How long does it last?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You tell me.
Did you?
You manifested that, Beth.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
But I have to, Norman.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
No.  I don't think so.
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
Did I?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
Fine.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Push her, c'mon.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
English?
The ships?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Well, he's polite.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I don't know.
Well, we'll see...
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
You mean I generate an energy field?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
There are only three or four left.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
And you?
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I read you sir.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I'm all ears.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Carmen...?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Eeuch !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Should I be ?
What's wrong with you ?
Which way ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Where'd it come from ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
On whose authority, Corporal ?
Can you walk ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
All dead except one, sir.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Then you acted properly, of course.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
What should you have known?
Why aren't you on board?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
Then you'll be wet.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
That: in an act of...
Mmm.
About <u>conflict</u>...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Gonna' be good as new.
Read the card.
I can't get it to come out right.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
It does?
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
We on for tomorrow night?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, that's right.
Hi!
Where have you been...
I have to tell you something...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Fifteen hands.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
What I...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I want you to hear this.
I, actually yes.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
...we had a script conference...
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
What?
Yes.
That's cor...
I can't tell.
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Doug, the traffic light...
He didn't have to tell...
Hi.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Who's White...?
The writer.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I'm out.
I don't know.
What is that...?
My oh my.
That's what I said.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got the permit.
Yeah?
Mmm.
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
And we're glad to have you here...
...the damn thing...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Look she's upset --
Like how?
That happens.  To families.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Mom?  What's wrong?
I'll miss you so much.
You lost Ben?!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
No.
Excuse me --
Poof!  You're happy now.
Rachel's job is she works.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Yes.
Rache says it's from you.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Rachel's not half my age.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Easy enough.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You're WHERE?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Called him.  We set an ap...
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's a huge moment in their life --
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
Not personally.
She was angry at herself.
Yes?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
You bet you are.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
And you said...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
And her...?
You weren't passing 'em out.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Thanks for coming out.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
They don't hate you --
Rache, it may take time.
I needed some time away.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
What?
Hey. What's up?
You know...Stanley...
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
It was God's will.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
You have a bay?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
I can read it to you.
Oh. What happens now?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
OK.
Hi, Dad!
Come here, give me a hug!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
You want some?
What is most important to you?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
How's the arm?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Come on, drink up.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Can I have a glass of water?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That's government property, Major.
Go back to sleep, baby.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Thank you, sir.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Go on, Major.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
What the hell is Plan-R?
Why can't you cancel it?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
That's what I said.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Primary circuit is live.
Primary bomb is live.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
He's dead, all right.
What do you mean?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
At the bottom of mines?
Can I have some?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
That was really great.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Uh, last night...
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Hey, man.
What?
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
In what way?
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Thanks. See man?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Thanks, man!
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
It's a mistake to think that.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, wow.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Sooze wants to see him.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
What'd you do?
This is my home.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
So you can give me more shit?
Your completely missing the point.
What? What do you stand for?
This is ridiculous!
I would've stopped it.
Jeff. Jeff.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
No, no.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
No. No, no, no.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Get off my roof!
Look at you!
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Jesus, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Soon.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
So where are you?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Another sex dream?
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Positive.
She thinks you went to the police.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
Hannah, we've...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Roll 'em.
I'll take it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Thanks.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Are you hungry?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
We're engaged.
Good.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
This is where you live?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
If you love me, Joe.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Gordon Cole?
Or shall I call my servant?
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
And you'll play Salome?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Well?
Of course it is.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
What's that?
What scene?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.

Shouldn't we wait for the others?
What's that?
What's the matter with you?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
I'm the greatest star of them all.
You are not dressed properly.
This room has not been used for a long time.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Haven't got a thing.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But what will happen?
He will be. In about five minutes.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
When can I see, you again ?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
That makes it worse.
Miss what?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
What an adorable hat.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Guess! Go on.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
What is this place?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Others?
It's lovely. . .
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
You look at them? How?
Zaltar, please help me.
There is a way.
Then teach me how.
Then come with me.
Yeah? What do you want?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
First paycheck?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Black or regular?
Columbia.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Is this blackmail?
For what?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
No, we're just going down.
We back in Metropolis?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Lots of things...
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
I don't kiss.
Small potatoes.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Lois, you're amazing.
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
It's true. It's true.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Everything on it?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
It has everything.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He has powers as we do . . .
What more?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
Yes?
I really don't think . . .
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Impossible? Why?
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's he going to say?
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
But . . . how could you beat him?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
One of them should've been you.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Are there any more at home like you?
Hey!
He may have a gun!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Can I take you to the airport?
I'm telling you, I was there.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Krypton!
Mr. Romance...
Don't let me down.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
You can't do this to me!
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Boy!
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
He is. Usually.
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
Please...
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
On radio waves?
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Ally.  That's right.
We're...not together.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which clinic?
Then...when did she get better?
But you said...
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't know.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Yes.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
What's vermin again?
Yes.
Nicole?
So he was mean?
I have no questions.
What about Doreen?
What do you mean?
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
What do they do?
Have they ever been busted?
Tell me about it.
I'm in a car wash.
News?
Oh God, I'm scared.
We do.
Yes.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Excuse me?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
You are?
Before the actual accident?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
You saw the speedometer?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
What's that?
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
The door needs a lock.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
But of course...
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Don't you know who that man is?
But what?
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
I know you do, Sidney.
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
J.J., if you think -
You haven't told him yet...
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
What chip?
Those lying motherfuckers!
Liquid metal.
Everything.
Does it hurt?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Smile?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Alriight!!  My man!
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Can it be destroyed?
Is it safe for them here?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I'm very sorry.
I guess you admire musicians.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. Pleasure.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
I have a duty.
No. Ours was damaged.
I'm sorry.
What is this, Emmi?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
No!
That's an outrageous lie!
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Helmuth.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Who's he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
They said I was dogged?
Alright!
Anything else?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Thanks a lot.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
What's that?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
My whole life has been combat.
I want it to be over for you.
He'll find us, won't he?
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Someone?
So much pain.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I don't think I like this.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Projections were far too optimistic.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I'm so sorry.
You've got to be kidding.
There's got to be a flashlight.
I'll give you a boost.
I'll wait.
This is C.R.S.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Never did catch your name.
What is it?
Take the picture out.
Wha... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
I'm back from the dead.
They won't...
Where'd you get that gun?
I didn't know what else to call you.
Single?
Boyfriend?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
No.
For you.
Okay.
What are you doing?
How did those... ?
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
What?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
A game?
Drive in.
Guess!
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Fine.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
I don't like her.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
He hasn't called back.
Sure.
It's not going to hold your weight.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Nell!  What's wrong?
Hmm.
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was.
What is that tune?
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No.
How'd I know it was for you?
This is where we're going?
Why?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
David.
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
It's not a compliment.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think someone is here.
Hey.
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Our black friends?
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Man knows what he likes.
No reason.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Uh-huh.
Didn't get it.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Been busy, have you.
That's not what I heard.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Oh, it just ended, then.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Something like that, yeah.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
My employer.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I don't believe it.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
What'd your father do?
Fancy it?
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Yeah, I guess you are.
So what's your beef, pal?
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Been away a lot.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
I don't know.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Boy.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Uh--
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
I can get it, yeah.
Right! Strictly business.
It's OK.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Your place?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
Just coffee.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
How's that?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
OK, how did you know?
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
So... who... who actually--
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
Taking it seriously.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
That was quite something.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Frank.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Behind you.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
Whose footprints?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
What's going on?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
How many storage areas are there?
Something tried to get into this room!
Where is that?
What's that?
Not that big.
They've got something.
Oh... my... God!
Oh no.  I smell it.
Margo, you haven't heard?
That's impossible.
What do you make of it, Margo?
How about lunch?
How does it work?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
What happened?
Where did you see it?
What was it?
We're not going to make the storage room!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Where exactly?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
Why would we--
Thank you.
Certainly a nomination.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
Oh, yes.
Now.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Yeah, what happened?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
What exactly?
Stay where you are!
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I made macaroni.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Oh, my God!
I won't be here Sunday.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
How's your hip?
I'll try.
Who?
There's no one here.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Not supposed to talk about it.
I need your clothes, Byers.
How can this be?
How's that?
You follow me out here for a reason?
How'd you find me?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Those people were already dead.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What was it?
What killed those men?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
-- You saw this experiment?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
You didn't know my father --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I think they have that covered.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Why?
You're... quitting?
It's like jelly.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Mulder --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
What are my choices?
You think they went left?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Very weird.
What are you doing?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
I can't go any farther.
I don't know anything about that.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
And they want to blame us?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
About the conspiracy?
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
More concerns than that?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
...a pocketful of rye.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What did you see?
I did, yeah.
Little boy?!  That's him!
Who says?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
What about the legalities of this...?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
Dr. Kent.
What about the cat?
Now?
Den leuten.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Who are you looking for now?
In German?
What's that?
When...what did you do?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Oh, the usual things...
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
No.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
My name is Calloway.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Do you see what that means?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
It wouldn't work.
Of course.
Yes.
And - Anna...
As long as they can use you?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
You remember me? Upstairs...
...Popescu...
You don't mean that doctor?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Something wrong.
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Mr. Martins...
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I'm sorry.
So from there to there?
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Watch your language....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
That's a movie, you moron.
Oh, please...
How come you know all this shit?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
How come there's no punctuation?
The sex is better.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Why should I submit?
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
And be crushed.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
You wouldn't announce it?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Female...
Of course they're Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Why would Nadelman lie?
I always won.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you...?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I don't do that.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
So what Jew would you kill first?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Steve...
What are you doing here?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
What kids?...
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
This will be a different kind of device.
Oh, what is this shit?
Where?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
I can tell....
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Eat shit....
What do you mean?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Johana, am I boring you?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
The Italian, I presume?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Congratulations.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Is it a poem?
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
The medics are looking all over for you.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
People say that?
No, no!
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
... Everything.
What is it?
You don't have that one, do you?
He doesn't like us.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I'm concentrating.
You look adorable.
You jumped in?
How do you know that?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Hello?
I'm still here.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
What?
You want to lie down for a while?
Well... here.
Louis, we were French!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
What?
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
A stereo type alarm system?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
So, how was I?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
The death card - -
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
What, senorita?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
It was you.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
State hunters?
You're too good to me.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Who is he?
I can use them.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Disney! How inter...
What... What are you talking about?
Laurence!
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard...
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Where is that?
Get to the point, will you...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Crow what?
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Hi...
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Where is he?
Who’s the money man?
What company?
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Okay. Recommended...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Vous êtes Français?
Problems?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Could that be Camden Market?
If he had, you’d be dead.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Are they still operative?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
It's a miracle she's not dead!
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
We must sound the retreat!
I don't know...
Didn't you also carry a banner?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
Yes.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
We need another ten minutes...
This is no good!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Yeah...
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
You don't believe me anymore?
Who gave you that horse?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
They won't come anyway.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Yes...
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I don't want to wait for his call.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Will I still be able to play?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
You sell anything?
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Otherwise what?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
What's all that gunfire?
I don't know how to thank you.
Like it were a piano?
Baines is packing up?
Well, that is a strong opinion.
On your property?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
You've missed this bit.
What's the line on Visitation?
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Mottola.
Hackers.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You sober?
You mean you blew it.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
You just worry about your end, kid.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But what about all these other people?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
What do you mean?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
What happened?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Is that what it means?
Cheer up, darling.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Then what are you hiding?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
How did you ever remember me?
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
Don't lie to me.
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
He's holding out on you.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Shut up.
Well, what?
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Where were you?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Oh, please, Nick.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
What do you think?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
You got types?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Six Martinis.
Who's that?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
What are you drinking?
No thanks.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Someone get a doctor.
You're a fine watch dog.
I never saw that before.
Aren't you hot in that?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
So am I.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
How did you get in here?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Yes.  Nick!
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Maybe she has.
What's in the other direction?
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
You just go when I say go.
Ready?
We can't just go off and--
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Missile!
What about the gold?
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Knock it off!
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Oh, that's fun.
They'll shoot us!
You can't tell anybody about this.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
What?
Where you going?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
This.  Whatever it is.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
We should head Northeast.
We'll find our way.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Sorry.
No!
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
But...
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Well?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah, well, we're not.
We have to go back.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Now?
It's 3+27 hundred
Don't take anything.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
no...no, no.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Good Lord!
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'll report you.  It's....
What are you doing here?
Which way?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
You don't know that!
Yes.
Yes...
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Who the heck're you?
Only once, at Redstone.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Where you guys at?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Lane oil...
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Vice... Jesus.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Yes, sir.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Amsterdam?
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
Why should you?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Seven and nine!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Five, seven, and nine--
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Now, Lily--
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes.
Yes.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
What's wrong now?
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then a little nap--
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Ah, let me have a little fun.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Yes--uh--
Please!  Thank you.
For all the really important things--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
The partners want to know how it's going?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.
We're too late.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Almost as good as you.
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
The fall alone would kill you.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Just some sketches.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Jack, must you go?
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Baloney!
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
I don't understand.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You'll excuse me. 
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Yes--are you?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
You work too fast for me, young man.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Sorry.
But--
Sally--!
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
How're the tips?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Say--wait a minute!
Come in! 
I'm going to the show--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
O.K.! Send that!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Well, did you find me?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Who won?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Am I a member of this club?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
No--not much--excepting-- 
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Somebody's got to do it--
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
So what?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Congratulations.
Say, "Thanks very much!"
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
He's certainly good-natured.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Nothin'.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
God damn son of a...
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Beauty, ain't he?
Shut up, Ike.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
That's the rumor.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Doc...
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Awful lot of money.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
That was lovely!
Fun though, wasn't it?
What about her?
Just doesn't, that's all.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
What can I get you?
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
No really, I can stay a while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
'Least they don't scare women.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
There they are.  No herd though.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
But -
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
I'm sure they will.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
- Four wheel drive?
Wait a minute -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is this another one of your games?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
It must do something.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
No.
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
And what do you call this?
He was my father's best friend!
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
... What's Harmsway done?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
I was an attorney!
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Take the men. I can finish alone.
It's Bond!
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Your feet are cold.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Good morning.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You should go back and rest.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Where is Skip?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Woody!  Buzz!
Toy?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
What's going on?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hey, watch it!
I don't know!
Hey!!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, no!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
What the heck is up there?
Last present!
Reach for the sky!!
Woody?!
I like plaits.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
Reprieve.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Victoria -
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
What?  What is it?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
So my wife is lying?
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
So's the video camera.
Not yet.
What's up?
You all right?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Private?
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
We aren't barbarians.
You will help me with my other problem.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
It's possible.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
She's not at that place you sent her?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Well, I've not brought them.
You've stabbed me, man.
Can you not go yourself.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Sorry.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Jesus.
What do you want?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Following the game at all?
No.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
I don't rate that at all.
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
I can't believe you did that.
Well, it's up to you.
you'll need one more hit.
Sure.
How long is it?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
With a starship!
Plotting our new course.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Position, Bird of Prey?
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Ah, Captain?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Go to sleep, Spock.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
...mark two.
What are you doing?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
You are mad!


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Spock?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Did he say why?
What for?
To warn him.
Of what?
Beautiful!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Come on in...
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
That all you can say?
I'm your program?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm sorry -
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
If you think -
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
How 'bout yourself?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
We have to talk.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Where are you going?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Why?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Copy that.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
He's got it.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Oral hygiene?
That's fabulous Harry.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Would you say he was boring, then?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
So what's your angle?
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Hello?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Yes.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him to look through it.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
I took a cab.
How 'bout me what?
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
How long have you worked here?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You didn't do nothing.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You're a whore?
Is he nice?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
What?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
What?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot Blitzer.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
No. But thanks.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No. No you're not.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
We grew up together.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
No.
What are you talkin' about?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
What about him?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
McTeague.
You and Robin moved?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Do you believe him?
We talked him into it.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
You do more than try.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
I understand.  There'd be no point.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
Change what?
I need to go.
You wouldn't understand.
Hiding?
1995?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
Mason???
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I don't understand what we're doing.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
You... you left them a message?
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What are you talking about???
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Nine thirty
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Will he be back soon?
Hey.
How much!?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What you want?
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Accident.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
You're welcome, Grace.
Least you can leave.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
How much money has he got?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Let's go in the bedroom.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
No.  I swear it.
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
How much could you get?
The time wasn't right.
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Jake--
It's the truth, Jake.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
You're not talking sense.
Got any requests?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Stand up.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Now, what's this?
The old lady?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Kids.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
What the fuck do you want?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Talk?  About what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
You Harlin?
Hey.
What the hell happened to my car?
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
How do you know he's still not here?
Walk away.
Nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You mean the Shaman?
In <u>cash</u>?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
There is no us, remember?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Why?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Where ya goin'?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
What'd you say to me!
What kind?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Is Noel in?
I've come to a decision.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
But not a knife?
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
I don't know what you're asking?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How much did you take off?
Know what?
Twelve years.
Why?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
He's coming ain't he?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Alive?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Did you... kill him?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Who killed him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
He said that, huh?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
No.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
What business?
You missed him? You didn't...?
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Eleven.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
He musta been movin' right along.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Jesus.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
That fella come by... Tom.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
Who said that?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
I don't like the question.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
There was ninety-one million -
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
Goddamnit.
I love you.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
County. I was in for fraud.
How do you do?
What the hell do you want?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You okay?
Three million?
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I don't know about that.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Came from Redfoot.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Very good.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It looks that way.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Yes.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Yes!
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Objection!
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Through, through his book.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
I wouldn't do it.
They lied.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
The Doctors were not negligent.
The most respected ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
... that's perfectly all right.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Mr. Galvin's...
From the magazine?
What Hotel are you staying at?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Is this a bad time.
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No.
I have to talk to you.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Admittance form is wrong.
Right.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Uh...the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
She did?
Hi.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yeah.
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Should I?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Would you like a drink now?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
How often does this happen?
How can I see her, to know her?
There are things you didn't tell me.
And when she goes to those places...
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
Who you are --
Just dinner.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
I like that one.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
The color of your hair...
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Where are you going?
Scottie, why are we here?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
I... didn't know where you lived.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
You've nothing to apologize for.
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
I don't like them.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Where?
Have you been here before?
Where were you born?
No, I can't tell you!
Where?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
No.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
I love you too... too late... too late...
Let me go! Let me go!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Oh, yes!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Would you please go and look?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Sorry, old man. Work.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
What's that?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Multiple reasons.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
So that's what we're doing.
That is absolutely not true.
We have to get going.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
Adam! Calm down.
Later.
Where's the candy?
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
What are you talking about?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Is everything okay?
Your investment ideas never work out.
What's goosed?
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Shut up.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
He is not cracking up.
What?
What's your point?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
What are you going to do?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
You hate women.
What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Easy Micheal.
What do you mean, you think so?
Caterer?
You forgot the tent?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Charles Moore for instants.
Of course.
Take care of those chairs.
I love you.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Just a bit of organizing.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'm working on it.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You did all right dad.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
What is it?
That ought to be about the end of that.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
You alright?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
"You Send Me."
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Take your time. I wish I had.
That's our plan.
Shut up Micheal.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Take me there.
Was that difficult to get?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
You must listen to me before you go.
She won't even know.
And in the vegetable plot?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
It's very good.
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?
You see how much you like her?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Is she coming back?
Very, very?
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
When you are, miss.
Have I slept long?
Today, a good girl.
What?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
He hears...everything.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It feels so.. .real.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How should I know?
Should I have?
It was you, wasn't it?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
You catching my drift?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
You all right?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
What does that mean?
Find out anything?
That's why I'm asking.
Sid?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
It's <u>producing</u>.
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...this is a snappy song....
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...The Albanian Campaign...
...twelve years.
...and...
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
....we landing?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Anything at the Airport?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
What are we going to do?
Oh, Lord....
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
We're due at Andrews. 
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
What do you want the kid to say?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
W...what?
What is it?
President's speech.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Mmm.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
A proud tradition.
Watch me.
Watch me.
Deal's changed.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
They look stupid.
You like it?
Yes.
I believe in you....
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
The hats.
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
A wider option of what?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
....beautiful.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
No, I think..
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Okay.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I don't understand.
What about hard work?
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
I gather you're a decorator.
Where is it?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You really do believe in destiny?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Do you think you're ready?
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
It's over you, Gordon.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
With Mark?
Weird and tiny huh?
Jenkins!
This time I really don't see anyone man.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
I know that.
That's not true.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
These are good.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
You think that'll help?
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
No.
What?
Who's that?
Um...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
I don't know.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Um...sure.
You must think I'm pathetic.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
...just so she could cut them off.
Do we have to?
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
How you holding up?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
You think he killed her?
Mef?  What's Mef?
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
Then what was it?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Why?
Relieved?
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Whatcha reading?
You are...
Tired?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Did you call the police?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Well, that's nice.
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
He killed her.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
When?
When you do this, I swear...
Harvey says he's amazing.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
What are you doing out here?
Keep your voice down.
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
I...
I may have seen her on campus.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
It's too rough.
Who?
I was there.
We don't know that for sure.
What?
What?
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
I'm cooking you dinner.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:Well, they are.
Two what...?
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
What are you talk---
When did she die...?
She didn't feel them
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
STOP!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Rowan...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
And whose houses do you design...?
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Hello...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
You alright...?
I can't.
Stop it!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
You okay...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
OH MY GAWD!
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Where are you going?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
It's been what, three years?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
You got everything you ever wanted.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Yeah? You like?
Do it?
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Watch your tone, mister.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Very funny.
If you could just sign right there.
You want it in writing?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You're a peach.
Your article sucked.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Don't write that part.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Wow...you clean up nice.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
But who would run the store?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
The skinny brunette.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Did he come in with you?
What was that?
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You didn't cuff her?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
I said he did.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I say something funny?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Hi, Mon.
He... Sam Lombardo?
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Yes.
Why can't you come...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Nellie Gail Ranch...
I just want my life back...
Just like that?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
That was about as grim as it gets.
Funny.  So am I.
You need that real often?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Now, what was that?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Well... that, too.
Relax.  We're almost there.
My God!  He's so excessive!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
She's perfectly safe.
Good work.  Really.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
I've even printed my own currency.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Because it's true.
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
Fresh goat's milk.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
You?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Get back here, Rool!
Madmartigan.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
No pistol. Ever.
Have you got your gun on now?
So one of them got to him.
What's your first move?
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Who are they?
Enjoying your reading?
Your husband's?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Won him over just like that.
I was being foolish?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Say again?
You're the first one he'll contact.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
God, Fred...
Is the English dead?
She say where he is?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Is this where we're going?
They are English. They don't understand.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Oh --
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
...didn't you?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
...her face is careworn.
Oh --
Oh -- 
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
I'll be home in time for supper!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Does it work?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
The other side....
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Yes -- there --
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Here --   Come on.
Fine.  He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
You mean she bit you?
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
It makes you nervous?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
How long has he been with you?
I can’t stay.
I don’t want to be safe!
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
Was this all about the oil?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
A rope!
No!  Get me out!
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
. . . What?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
What are you up to?
They're following us.
They're practically on us . . .
Yes you are.
What's he doing?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
What new information?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Why is that?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Is that all?
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Thanks.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Yorgi asked me to.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Who are you?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Yorgi and Kirill.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
What are you doing?
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
I'm through, Xander.
What...?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Why you dogging me up?
What's so damn funny?
What's going on, my friend?
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
I don't like him being here.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He takes himself seriously.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Who?
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
Don't you knock?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Give him an extra dollar.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
What?
Miss me?
Whatever makes you happy.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Dr. Frankenstein?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
How old are you, young man?
Are you putting me on?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Was he any good?
Hmm!
That's not bad.
Tonight?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
You can say that again.
What???
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Well...
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
And look at this, Doctor!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
